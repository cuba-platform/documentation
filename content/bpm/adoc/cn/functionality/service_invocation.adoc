=== Middleware Beans Methods Invocation

The *Service task* node is used to invoke a service method. Activiti engine is integrated with the Spring framework, so you can access middleware beans by their names. To invoke a method of a managed bean use the following expression to the *Expression* field:

[source,groovy]
----
${beanName.methodName(processVarName, 'someStringParam')}
----

You can use process variables as method arguments, including the variables automatically created on process start (`entityId`, `bpmProcInstanceId`, etc. as described in <<services.adoc#process_runtime_service>>).

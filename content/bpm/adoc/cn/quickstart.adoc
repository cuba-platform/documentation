[[quick_start]]
== Quick Start

In this chapter, we will create a small project to demonstrate how to use the business processes subsystem. As an illustration, we will implement a contract approval process software.

Commonly an approval process involves the following steps:

* A user creates the `Contract` object, defines actors and initiates an approval process.
* An actor with the `Controller` role receives the task to validate an attached contract.
* If the validation is passed then the contract is transferred to the users with the `Manager` role assigned, otherwise the process will be terminated with `Not valid` state.
* After the associated managers approve or reject the contract it turns, respectively, into the `Approved` or `Not approved` state.

[[qs_project_creation]]
=== Creating the Project
. Create a new project in Cuba Studio:

* Project name: `bpm-demo`
* Project namespace: `demo`
* Root package: `com.company.bpmdemo`

image::StudioNewProject.png[align="center"]

[start=2]
. Open the project properties window (*Project properties* section, *Edit* button).
. Activate the BPM subsystem in the *App components* list.

image::StudioSelectBpmModule.png[align="center"]

[start=4]
. Press *OK* button at the *Project properties* page. The system will ask you for the confirmation. Agree.

[[qs_data_model_creation]]
=== Creating the Data Model

Go to the *Data model* tab and press *New > Entity*. The class name is `Contract`.

image::CreateContractEntity.png[align="center"]

Create the following entity attributes:

* `number` (`String` type)
* `date` (`Date` type)
* `state` (`String` type)

image::ContractEntityAttributes.png[align="center"]

Go to the *Instance name* tab and add the `number` attribute to *Name pattern attributes*.

image::ContractEntityNamePattern.png[align="center"]

Press the *OK* button to save the entity.

[[qs_standard_screen_creation]]
=== Creating Standard Screens

Select the `Contract` entity in the *Data model* section and click *New > Generic UI screen*. In the list of screen templates, select *Entity browser and editor screens* and click *Create*. Close the list of templates.

image::CreateContractScreens.png[align="center"]

[[qs_approvalHelper]]
=== Creating ApprovalHelper Bean

The `updateState()` method of the `ApprovalHelper` bean will be invoked from the contract approval process for setting a contract state.

Method parameters:

* `entityId` - contract entity identifier
* `state` - contract state

Open the project in an IDE. Create `ApprovalHelper` class in the `com.company.bpmdemo.core` package.

[[qs_run_app]]
=== Creating the Database and Running the Application

Click the *Generate DB scripts* button on the *Data model* section. Then click the *Create database* button on the *Database scripts* page.

image::StudioCreateDatabase.png[align="center"]

Start the application server using *Run -> Start application server* menu command.

Open the application in a web browser at `++http://localhost:8080/app++` or just click the link on the Studio status panel.

[[qs_process_creation]]
=== Creating the Process

In this section, we will create and deploy the process.

[[qs_process_model_creation]]
==== Creating the Process model

The final version of the process model will look like this:

image::ProcessFull.png[align="center"]

Let's take a look at the steps needed to create the model.

In the web interface of the running application, open the *BPM -> Process Models* screen and click *Create*. Enter `Contract approval` for the model name and click *OK*. *Model Editor* will be opened in a new browser tab.

[TIP]
====
A notification with a clickable link is shown in case of creating or copying the process model. In case of clicking the *Edit* button, the process model editor is shown in the new tab.
====

Select the *Process roles* property in the model properties panel. The Process roles edit window will be opened.

image::ProcessRolesProperty.png[align="center"]

Two types of actors participate in the process: a manager and a controller. Create two roles: `Controller` and `Manager`.

image::ProcessRolesEditor.png[align="center"]

Drag and drop the *Start event* node from the *Start Events* group to the workspace.

We need to display a form to select process actors when the process starts. Select the start event node. Select the *Start form* in its properties panel - a form selection window will appear. Select `Standard form` in the *Form name* field. Then add two form parameters:

* `procActorsVisible` with `true` value indicates that a table for process actors selection will be displayed on the form.
* `attachmentsVisible` with `true` value indicates that a table for uploading attachments will be displayed on the form.

image::StartForm.png[align="center"]

Add the *User task* node from the *Activities* group to the model. Name it `Validation`.

image::ModelValidationNode.png[align="center"]

Select this node and assign the `controller` value to the *Process role* property at the properties panel. This way we define that the task will be assigned to a process actor with the `controller` role.

image::SelectProcRoleForValidation.png[align="center"]

Next, select the *Task outcomes* property. The window for task outcomes edit will be opened. Outcomes define possible user actions when users receive tasks. Create two outcomes: `Valid` and `Not valid`. Define the `Standard form` for both outcomes. Add form parameter `commentRequired=true` for the `Not valid` outcome, because we want to make a user add a comment in case of invalid contract.

image::OutcomesForValidation.png[align="center"]

Depending on the controller's decision we have to send the contract to managers approval or to finish the process with the `Not valid` state. The *Exclusive gateway* node from the *Gateways* group is used to control the process flow. Add it to the workspace and then add two more elements: *Script task* with `Set 'Not valid' state` name and *User task* with `Approval` name. Name the flow to the *Script task* as `Not valid` and the flow to the *User task* as `Valid`.

image::ModelValidationExclGateway.png[align="center"]

Select the `Not valid` flow. Expand the *Flow outcome* dropdown list from the properties panel. It shows outcomes from the tasks before the gateway. Select the `Not valid` value.

image::NotValidFlowOutcome.png[align="center"]

Now, if the `Not valid` outcome is selected, a transition to this flow will be performed.

The `Valid` flow should be marked as the default flow (if no other flows condition is true). Select the `Valid` flow and tick the *Default flow* property.

[WARNING]
====
There must be no value selected in the *Flow outcome* dropdown list for the flow marked as default.
====

Next, select the *Exclusive gateway* and open its *Flow order* property editor. Make sure that the `Not valid` flow is on the first place in the list. Change the flows sequence if necessary.

image::ValidationFlowOrder.png[align="center"]

Let's move on to the `Set 'Not valid' state` node. We need to set the `state` property of the Contract entity to the `Not valid` value. Select the node. Set the *Script format* property value to `groovy`. Click on the *Script* property field - the script editor will be opened. Copy and paste the following code there:

[source,groovy]
----
def em = persistence.getEntityManager()
def contract = em.find(com.company.bpmdemo.entity.Contract.class, entityId)
contract.setState('Not valid')
----

You can use process variables and `persistence` and `metadata` platform objects (see Developer's Manual) in scripts. The `entityId` variable is created on process start and stores an identifier of the linked entity.

After the contract state is changed, the process should be finished. Let's add the *End event* node from the *End events* group to the workspace and connect the node with the `Set 'Not valid' state`.

Let's go back to the `Approval` task. Define the `manager` process role for it like we did for the first task. In order for the task to be assigned to many managers simultaneously, set its *Multi-instance type* property to `Parallel`.

image::ApprovalMutlInstanceType.png[align="center"]

Create two task outcomes: `Approve` and `Reject` (*Task outcomes* property). For both outcomes, set the `Standard form` form and set `commentRequired` parameter to `true` for the `Reject` outcome.

After the approval is completed, either `Approved` or `Not approved` status should be assigned to the contract depending on the approval result. Add an *Exclusive gateway* node after the `Approval task`. Add two *Service task* after the exclusive gateway: `Set 'Approved' state` and `Set 'Not approved' state`. They will do the same thing as the *Script task* we have added earlier, but in a different way: by invoking a Spring bean method. Name the flow to the `Set 'Approved' state` as `Approved`, and the flow to the `Set 'Not approved' state` as `Not approved`.

image::ModelWithApproval.png[align="center"]

Select the `Not approved` flow node and select the `Reject` value in the *Flow outcome* list. Now if at least one of the managers performs the `Reject` action then this outcome will be initiated. Select the `Approved` flow node and check the *Default flow* checkbox. This means that if no other flow is initiated then this flow will be used.

Set the flow order for *Exclusive gateway* like we did for the previous one. Select *Exclusive gateway* and open the *Flow order* property editor. `Not approved` should be processed first.

image::ApprovalFlowOrder.png[align="center"]

Let's go back to the Service task. Select the `Set 'Approved' state` node and set its *Expression* property to the following value:

[source,groovy]
----
${demo_ApprovalHelper.updateState(entityId, 'Approved')}
----

Apply the following script for the `Set 'Not approved' state`:

[source,groovy]
----
${demo_ApprovalHelper.updateState(entityId, 'Not approved')}
----

The Activiti engine is integrated with the Spring framework, so we can access Spring managed beans by their names. `entityId` is a process variable that stores an identifier of the contract which is linked to the process. Its value is set on the process start.

Connect both service tasks with the *End event* and click the save button. The model is ready and we can move on to the model deployment.

image::ProcessFull.png[align="center"]

[[qs_process_model_deployment]]
==== Process Model Deployment

The model deployment process consists of the following steps:

* Generating a process XML in BPMN 2.0 notation from the model.
* Deploying the process to Activiti engine internal tables.
* Creating a `ProcDefinition` object that relates to the Activiti process.
* Creating `ProcRole` objects for process roles defined in the model.

Select the model in the list on the *Process Models* screen. Press the *Deploy* button. The model deployment window will be displayed. The model is deployed for the first time, so the *Create new process* option is selected. You will be able to deploy the model to existing processes for further model changes. Click *OK*. The process definition is created.

image::DeployModelScreen.png[align="center"]

Open the screen *BPM -> Process Definitions*. Open the `Contract approval` item for editing. The *Code* field value is `contractApproval`. Remember this value - we will use it to identify the process definition later in this chapter.

image::ProcDefinitionEdit.png[align="center"]

[[qs_screens_adaptation]]
=== Adapting Screens to the Process

In this section, we will add an ability to work with the contract approval process to the contract editor screen.

[[qs_contract_edit_descriptor]]
==== Contract Editor Screen Layout

Find the `contract-edit.xml` screen in the *Screens* panel in Studio and open the screen for editing. Go to the *XML* tab and completely replace its content with the following code:

[source,xml]
----
include::{sourcesdir}/quickstart/contract-edit.xml[]
----

Go to the *Layout* tab. The resulting screen layout is shown below:

image::ContractEditStudioLayout.png[align="center"]

The screen contains a FieldGroup for contract editing, a frame for displaying process actions, and a table with process attachments.

[[qs_contract_edit_controller]]
==== Contract Editor Controller

Go to the *Controller* tab and replace its content with the following code:

[source,java]
----
include::{sourcesdir}/quickstart/ContractEdit.java[]
----

Click *OK* to save the changes.

Let's examine the controller code in details.

The `ProcActionsFrame` is the frame that displays process actions available to the user at the moment. On initialization, the frame searches for a related `ProcInstance` object by two parameters: process code and entity instance. If the `ProcInstance` object is not found then a new instance is created and the frame displays the start process button. If the related process instance is found then the frame searches for an uncompleted process task for the current user and displays buttons for process task actions. See <<ui.adoc#proc_actions_frame>> for details.

In the contract editor, the process actions frame initialization is performed in the `initProcActionsFrame()` method. The main part of the method is the invocation of the `init(PROCESS_CODE, getItem())`. The `PROCESS_CODE` stores a process code (`contractApproval` - we saw this value during the model deployment, see <<qs_process_model_deployment>>). The second argument `getItem()` is the current contract.

The `standard()` initialization does the following:

* initializes standard process actions predicates that will be invoked before the process is started and before process tasks are completed. The predicates commit the entity editor.

* initializes standard listeners that will show notifications like "Process started" or "Task completed" and refresh the `procActionsFrame` after the process is started or process task is completed.

[[qs_localization]]
==== Localized Messages

In Studio, open the `messages.properties` file from the package containing contract screens. Replace its content with the following text:

[source]
----
browseCaption = Contract browser
editorCaption = Contract editor
attachments = Attachments
process = Contract approval
----

[[qs_work_with_app]]
=== Working With the Application

Hot deploy mechanism is enabled in Studio by default, so all changes in screens should already be applied to the running application. If hot deploy is disabled, restart the server using the *Run -> Restart application server* menu command.

[[qs_users_creation]]
==== Creating Users

In order to demonstrate the process, create three users in the *Administration -> Users* screen:

* login: `norman`, First name: `Tommy`, Last name: `Norman`
* login: `roberts`, First name: `Casey`, Last name: `Roberts`
* login: `pierce`, First name: `Walter`, Last name: `Pierce`

[[qs_start_process]]
==== Creating a Contract and Starting the Process

* Open the *Application -> Contracts* screen and create a new contract. Fill in the *Number* and *Date* fields and click *Save*.
* Click *Start process* button, the start process form should appear. During the model creation we defined the `Standard form` with attributes `procActorsVisible=true` and `attachmentsVisible=true` for the *Start event* node. That's why now we see the form with the process actors and attachments tables.
* Enter a comment and add actors: the controller is `norman` and the two managers are `pierce` and `roberts`.
* Add an attachment by using an *Upload* button from the attachments table.

image::StartProcessForm.png[align="center"]

[start=5]
. Press *OK*. Now the process is started.

[[qs_validation]]
==== Controller Validation Stage

Log in as `norman`.

When the process reaches the *User task* node, a `ProcTask` object is created. This object is linked to the particular process actor. The BPM subsystem has a screen for displaying uncompleted tasks for the current user: *BPM -> Process Tasks*.

image::ProcTaskBrowse.png[align="center"]

We see that the user `norman` has one uncompleted task `Validation` of the `Contract approval` process. Select it and click the *Open entity editor* button. The contract edit screen will appear:

image::ContractEditValidation.png[align="center"]

The current user (`norman`) has an uncompleted task (ProcTask), so the `procActionsFrame` displays available process actions. When we were defining the `Validation` UserTask node, we set two possible outcomes: `Valid` and `Not valid`. That's why two buttons are added to the `procActionsFrame`.

Click the *Valid* button and enter a comment in the opened window:

image::ValidationCompleteForm.png[align="center"]

Click *OK*.

After the successful validation, the contract should go to the parallel approval by managers.

[[qs_approval]]
==== Manager Approval Stage

Log in as the `pierce` user.

Open the list of tasks for the current user: *BPM -> Process tasks*. You can see the `Approval` task.

image::TaskListApproval.png[align="center"]

Select the task and this time click the *Open process instance* button. The system screen for working with the process instance will be opened.

image::ProcInstanceEditApproval.png[align="center"]

It displays the information about the process start time, initiator, attachments list, actors and process instance tasks list. The screen also allows you to open a linked entity editor and execute a process action.

Pay attention to the *Tasks* table. The previous task `Validation` has been completed with the `Valid` outcome, and two new `Approval` tasks have been created for managers `pierce` and `roberts`.

Approve the contract pressing the *Approve* button.

Then log in as `roberts`. Open the contract from the list in *Application -> Contracts*.

User `roberts` has an uncompleted task, so the `procActionsFrame` displays *Approve* and *Reject* actions. Click the *Reject* button.

image::CompleteApprovalForm.png[align="center"]

When we were defining the `Reject` outcome in the model designer, we set the `commentRequired` form parameter to `true`, therefore you see that the comment is required in the task complete form. Enter the comment and press *OK*.

One of the managers has rejected the contract, so the `Not approved` state should be assigned to the contract. Let's check it. Open the contract.

image::ContractEditNotApproved.png[align="center"]

The approval process is completed with the `Not approved` state.

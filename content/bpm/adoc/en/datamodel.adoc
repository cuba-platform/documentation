NOTE: Attributes which names start with *act prefix are references to the Activiti identifiers.

* `ProcModel` - the process model. Model attributes:
**  `name` - the model name.
**  `description` - the model description.
**  `actModelId` - ID of a model from Activiti engine, stored in ACT_RE_MODEL table.
* `ProcDefinition` - the process definition. Entity attributes:
** `name` - the process name.
** `code` - the process code. It can be used to determine an entity instance from the application code.
** `actId` - ID of a process from Activiti.
** `active` - defines, whether a new process instance start is allowed for the current ProcDefinition.
** `procRoles` - collection of objects that defines process actors.
** `model` - the reference to a model.
* `ProcRole` - the process role. Objects of this type are created automatically on process deployment. ProcRole defines a process actor type. Entity attributes:
** `name` - the role name.
** `code` - the role code. It can be used by an application for a role identification.
** `order` - the order number. It can be used by an application to display roles in an appropriate order.
** `procDefinition` - the reference to a process definition.
* `ProcInstance` - the process instance. ProcInstance can be started both with a link to a project entity and without a link. For example, the contract approval process instance can be linked with a contract entity. Entity attributes:
** `description` - the description of a process instance.
** `startDate` - the process instance start date.
** `endDate` - the process instance end date
** `startedBy` - the user who started a process.
** `active` - the indicator that shows if a process was started but hasn't been completed yet.
** `cancelled` - the indicator that shows if a process was canceled.
** `actProcessInstanceId` - the identifier of the corresponding ProcessInstance from Activiti.
** `startComment` - the comment on process start.
** `cancelComment` - the comment on process cancel.
** `entityName` - the linked entity name.
** `entityId` - the linked entity ID.
** `entityEditorName` - the screen name that will be used to edit the linked entity.
** `procTasks` - the process tasks collection.
** `procActors` - the process actors collection.
** `procAttachments` - the process attachments collection.
* `ProcActor` - the process participant. The entity defines an executor with a particular role for a process instance. Entity attributes:
** `user` - the reference to a user.
** `procInstance` - the reference to a process instance.
** `procRole` - the reference to a process role.
** `order` - the order number. The field is used to define the order of actors for a sequential task for multiple users.
* `ProcTask` - the process task. Objects of this type are automatically created when a process reaches the User task node. Entity attributes:
** `name` - the task name.
** `startDate` - the task start date.
** `claimDate` - the claim date. The field is used in a case of a task without an explicit process actor.
** `endDate` - the task end date.
** `outcome` - the task completion result.
** `comment` - the task completion comment.
** `procActor` - the executor.
** `actTaskId` - the Activiti task ID. This field is used to report the Activiti engine about task completion.
** `actExecutionId` - the Activiti execution ID. This field is used for process variables read/write.
** `actTaskDefinitionKey` - in a process XML it is an `id` attribute of the UserTask element. It is used for building a name of a variable that stores the task result (`[task_id]_result`). See <<functionality.adoc#transitions>>.
** `cancelled` - the identifier that shows if the task was completed on process cancelation.
** `candidateUsers` - the list of possible process actors for a group task.
** `procInstance` - the reference to a process instance.
* `ProcAttachment` - the process attachment. Entity attributes:
** `file` - the reference to FileDescriptor.
** `type` - the attachment type (ProcAttachmentType).
** `comment` - the comment.
** `author` - the reference to the author of an attachment.
** `procInstance` - the reference to a process instance.
** `procTask` - the optional reference to a process task.
* `ProcAttachmentType` - the attachment type. Entity attributes:
** `code` - the attachment type code.
** `name` - the attachment type name.

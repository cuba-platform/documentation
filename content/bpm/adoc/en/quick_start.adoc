== Quick Start

In this chapter, we will create a small project to demonstrate how to use the business processes add-on. As an illustration, we will implement a contract approval process software.

Usually, an approval process involves the following steps:

* A user creates the `Contract` object, defines actors and initiates an approval process.
* An actor with the `Controller` role receives the task to validate an attached contract.
* If the validation is passed then the contract is transferred to the users with the `Manager` role assigned, otherwise the process will be terminated with `Not valid` state.
* After the associated managers approve or reject the contract it turns, respectively, into the `Approved` or `Not approved` state.

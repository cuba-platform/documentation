== Quick Start

This chapter describes the example of using the full text search subsystem in the Library sample application which can be downloaded by means of CUBA Studio.

We will split the task into the following stages:

. Enable search functionality for the project, configure the indexing process and verify that it works.
. Adjust the FTS configuration file to include entities from the sample Library data model.
. Use the `BookPublication` entity and the functionality of file upload described in the *File Storage* section of the *Developer's Manual* to illustrate search function for the loaded files.

[[qs_project_setup]]
=== Project Setup

. Run CUBA Studio, go to *Open project* -> *Samples* window and download the Library project.
. Open the Library project in Studio.
. Open *Project properties* -> *Edit*, select the *fts* component in the list of *App components* and save changes. Confirm when Studio suggests recreating Gradle scripts.
. Select *Run* -> *Deploy*. At this point, the application will be assembled and deployed to the Tomcat application server located at *build/tomcat*.
. Create the application database: *Run* -> *Create database*.
. Start the application server: *Run* -> *Start application server*.
. Open the application's web-interface at http://localhost:8080/app[http://localhost:8080/app]. Log into the system with the name *`admin`* and password *`admin`*.
. To enable full text search functionality, open *Administration* -> *JMX Console* in the application main menu, find and open the `app-core.fts:type=FtsManager` JMX bean. Open the *Enable* attribute using double click and check the *Value* checkbox.

Once the steps above are completed, full text search functionality will be added to the application and ready to work. If you log out of the system and then log in again, a search field will appear in the top right panel of the main application window. However, search will not produce any results because the data has not been indexed yet.

To start one-off indexing of the current state of the database (i.e. the entities listed in the FTS configuration file by default), open the `app-core.fts:type=FtsManager` JMX bean again and consequently invoke `reindexAll()` first and then `processQueue()`. After this, searching the "adm" string should give the following results:

[[qs_indexing]]
=== Configuring Invocation of Indexing Process

You can use the platform's scheduled tasks mechanism (see *Application Development Guide* -> *<<scheduled_tasks_cuba, CUBA Scheduled tasks>>*) to invoke indexing process on a scheduled basis.

First, you will need to activate the task starting functionality itself. Add the following property to the `app.properties` file of the project *core* module:

[source, properties]
----
cuba.schedulingActive = true
----

Restart the application server, log into the system as *`admin`*, open the JMX Console screen, find and open the `app-core.cuba:type=Scheduling` JMX bean and make sure that the *Active* attribute is set to `true`.

Then open the *Administration* -> *Scheduled Tasks* screen, click *Create* and fill in the following attribute values for a new task:

* *Defined by*: Bean
* *Bean name*: cuba_FtsManager
* *Method name*: processQueue()
* *Singleton*: true
* *Period, sec*: 30

Save the task, select it in the table and click *Activate*. From now on, the system will start indexing changed entities every 30 seconds.

[WARNING]
====
Automatic indexing does not cover the entities created before its start. To put such entities to the indexing queue use `reindexAll()` or `asyncReindexAll()` methods of the `app-core.fts:type=FtsManager` JMX bean. See <<reindex>>.

[[qs_conf]]
=== Setting up Configuration File

When you add  `fts` base project, the new `fts.xml` file is created with the following content
 in the source text directory of the *core* module:

[source, xml]
----
<fts-config>
    <entities>

        <entity class="com.sample.library.entity.Author">
            <include re=".*"/>
        </entity>

        <entity class="com.sample.library.entity.Book">
            <include re=".*"/>
        </entity>

        <entity class="com.sample.library.entity.BookInstance">
            <include re=".*"/>
        </entity>

        <entity class="com.sample.library.entity.BookPublication">
            <include re=".*"/>
        </entity>

        <entity class="com.sample.library.entity.LibraryDepartment">
            <include re=".*"/>
        </entity>

        <entity class="com.sample.library.entity.LiteratureType">
            <include re=".*"/>
        </entity>

        <entity class="com.sample.library.entity.Publisher">
            <include re=".*"/>
        </entity>

        <entity class="com.sample.library.entity.Town">
            <include re=".*"/>
        </entity>

    </entities>
</fts-config>
----

This is the FTS configuration file, which in our case enables indexing of all domain model entities with all their attributes.

The following property is automatically added to the *app.properties* file of the application
*core* module:

[source, properties]
----
cuba.ftsConfig = cuba-fts.xml fts.xml
----

As a result, indexing will include both the entities defined in the platform's *cuba-fts.xml* and the project's *fts.xml* files.

Restart the application server. From now on, full text search should work for all entities of the application model as well as entities of the platform security subsystem: `Role`, `Group`, `User`.

[[qs_search_files]]
=== Uploaded Files Content Search
Now we need to provide the possibility of file upload for each book publication
and to add uploaded files to the `BookPublication` browse screen.

Let us customize `BookPublication` entity. Firstly we add a new `file` attribute which is a many-to-one ASSOCIATION to
`FileDescriptor` entity. `FileDescriptor` is the descriptor of the uploaded file (not to be confused
with `java.io.FileDescriptor`) that enables referencing the file from the data model objects.
When saving the changes, select all screens and related views suggested by the Studio to append new
attribute.


image::book_publication_new_attribute.png[align="center"]

Generate new DB scripts, update database and restart application server. When DB is recreated, full text search becomes disabled by default. Check the *Value* checkbox again in *JMX Console*, reindex all files, process indexing queue, log out and log in back.


As far as we have added the new attribute, the table of publications on `BookPublication` browser screen now contains one more column: *File*.
To fill it in, open any line for editing, upload text file using the new upload field and click OK. By default CUBA supports
`RTF`, `TXT`, `DOC`, `DOCX`, `XLS`, `XSLX`, `ODT`, `ODS`, and `PDF` file formats.

image::book_publication_file_is_not.png[align="center"]

New files appeared in the table. The appearance of new column can be adjusted.

image::book_publication_files_uploaded.png[align="center"]

Open the *JMX Console* screen, open the `app-core.fts:type=FtsManager` JMX bean and invoke sequentially `reindexAll()` and `processQueue()` to re-index the existing instances in the database and files according to the new search configuration. All new and changed data will be indexed automatically with a delay depending on the scheduled task interval, i.e. not longer than 30 seconds.

As a result, *Full text search* will now output all the entries including external files contents.

You can find more information on `FileStorageAPI` and `FileDescriptor` in corresponding chapters of the main manual.

[[reindex]]

=== Running and configuring entities reindexing

If full text search was added to the project when some data is already added to the database, then this data sould be indexed. You can add entities to the indexing queue with methods of `app-core.fts:type=FtsManager` JMX-bean. A convenient way to invoke JMX-bean method is *JMX Console* screen of *Administration* menu.

JMX-bean `app-core.fts:type=FtsManager` provides two methods for adding entities to the indexing queue:

 * `reindexAll()` - synchronously adds entities described in FTS config to the indexing queue. In case of large amounts of data this process can take a lot of time, so using the `asyncReindexAll()` is recommended.

 * `asyncReindexAll()` - entities are added to the indexing queue asynchronously in batches with the `FtsManager.reindexNextBatch()` method. The batch size is defined by the <<chapter2.adoc#fts.reindexBatchSize,fts.reindexBatchSize>> configuration parameter. `FtsManager.reindexNextBatch()` method should be invoked by the scheduled tasks mechanism or by Spring scheduler. Indexing is not performed until indexing queue building is completed.

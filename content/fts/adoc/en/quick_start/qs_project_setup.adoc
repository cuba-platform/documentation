=== Project Setup

. https://github.com/cuba-platform/sample-library-cuba7/archive/master.zip[Download] and unzip the source repository of the *library* application, or clone it using git:
+
----
  git clone https://github.com/cuba-platform/sample-library-cuba7
----
. Open the Library project as described in the {studio_man_url}/open_project.html[Opening an Existing Project] section of the {studio_man_url}/index.html[CUBA Studio User Guide].

. Open the *Project Properties* editor in CUBA Studio: click *CUBA* -> *Project Properties* main menu item. Add the *fts* application component in the *App components* list. Confirm when Studio suggests recreating Gradle scripts.

. Assemble the project: click *CUBA* -> *Build Tasks* -> *Assemble* main menu item. At this stage, all required libraries will be downloaded and project artifacts will be assembled in `build` subdirectories of the project modules.

. Create the database on the local *HyperSQL* server: click *CUBA* -> *Create database* main menu item.

. Start the application as described in the {studio_man_url}/start_app.html[Starting the Application] section of the {studio_man_url}/index.html[CUBA Studio User Guide].

. Open the *library* application.
+
The username and password are `admin` / `admin`.
+

. To enable full-text search functionality, open *Administration* -> *Application properties* in the application main menu, find and open the *`fts`* list of properties in the table. Open the *fts.enabled* property using double-click and select *true* in the *Current value* field.

Once the steps above are completed, full-text search functionality will be added to the application and ready to work. If you log out of the system and then log in again, a search field will appear in the top right panel of the main application window. Full-text search can also be used in the link:{main_man_url}/gui_Filter.html#gui_Filter_fts[Filter] UI component.

However, search will not produce any results because the data has not been indexed yet.

To start one-off indexing of the current state of the database (i.e. the entities listed in the FTS configuration file by default), open the *Administration* -> *JMX Console*, find the `app-core.fts:type=FtsManager` JMX bean and consequently invoke `reindexAll()` first and then `processQueue()`.

After this, searching the "adm" string should give the following results:

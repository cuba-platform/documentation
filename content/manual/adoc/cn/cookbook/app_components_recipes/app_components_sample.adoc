==== Example of Application Component

In this section, we'll consider a complete example of creating an application component and using it in a project. The component will provide a "Customer Management" functionality and include the `Customer` entity and corresponding UI screens. The application will use the `Customer` entity from the component as a reference in its `Order` entity.

Creating the Customer Management component::

. Create a new project in Studio and specify the following properties on the *New project* screen:

* *Project name* - `customers`

* *Project namespace* - `cust`

* *Root package* - `com.company.customers`

. Edit *Project properties* and on the *Advanced* tab, set the *Module prefix* to `cust`.

. Create the `Customer` entity with at least the `name` attribute. Switch to the *Instance name* tab and add `name` to the name pattern attributes.

[WARNING]
====
If your component contains `@MappedSuperclass` persistent classes, make sure they have descendants which are entities (i.e. annotated with `@Entity`) in the same project. Otherwise such base classes will not be properly enhanced and you will not be able to use them in applications.
====

. Generate DB scripts and create standard screens for the `Customer` entity: `cust$Customer.browse` and `cust$Customer.edit`. After that, go to main menu designer and rename the `application` menu item to `customerManagement`.

. Click to the *App component descriptor* link on the *Project properties* panel. Save the generated descriptor by clicking *OK*.

. Test the Customer Management functionality: *Run > Create database*, *Run > Start application server*, then open `++http://localhost:8080/cust++` in your web browser.

. Install the application component into the local Maven repository by executing the *Run > Install app component* menu command.

Creating the Sales application::

. Create a new project in Studio and specify the following properties on the *New project* screen:

* *Project name* - `sales`

* *Project namespace* - `sales`

* *Root package* - `com.company.sales`

. Edit *Project properties* and on the *Advanced* tab check *Use local Maven repository* checkbox.

. Switch back to the *Main* tab and on the *App components* panel click the plus button next to *Custom components*. In the *Custom application component* dialog, select the `customers` project in the *Registered project* drop-down list. The list contains all projects registered in Studio that have an `app-component.xml` descriptor. Click *OK* in the dialog. The Maven coordinates of the Customer Management component will appear in the list of custom components. Save the project properties by clicking *OK*.

. Create the `Order` entity and add the `date` and `amount` attributes. Then add the `customer` attribute as a many-to-one association with the `Customer` entity - it should be available in the *Type* drop-down list.

. Generate DB scripts and create standard screens for the `Order` entity. When creating standard screens, create an `order-with-customer` view that includes the `customer` attribute and use it for the screens.

. Test the application functionality: *Run > Create database*, *Run > Start application server*, then open `++http://localhost:8080/app++` in your web browser. The application will contain two top level menu items: *Customer Management* and *Application* with the corresponding functionality.

Modifying the Customer Management component::

Suppose we have to change the component functionality (add an attribute to `Customer`) and then reassemble the application to incorporate the changes.

. Open the `customers` project in Studio.

. Edit the `Customer` entity and add the `address` attribute. When saving the entity, select both browser and editor screens to include the new attribute.

. Generate DB scripts - a script for altering table will be created. Save the scripts.

. Test the changes in the component: *Run > Update database*, *Run > Start application server*, then open `++http://localhost:8080/cust++` in your web browser.

. Re-install the application component into the local Maven repository by executing the *Run > Install app component* menu command.

. Close the `sales` project in Studio (if it is open) and open it again. This is necessary to download the new component source code in Studio.

. Execute *Build > Clean*, then *Build > Assemble project* menu commands.

. Execute *Run > Update database* - the update script from the Customer Management component will be executed.

. Execute *Run > Start application server* and open `++http://localhost:8080/app++` in your web browser - the application will contain the `Customer` entity and screens with the new `address` attribute.

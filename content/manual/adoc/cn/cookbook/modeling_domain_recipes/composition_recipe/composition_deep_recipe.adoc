Composition can be deeper, with up to two nested levels. Let's extend the <<composition_impl_recipe,previous>> example by adding a `MeetingPoint` entity describing a meeting point at an airport terminal:

The `Terminal` entity contains the `meetingPoints` attribute – a collection of the `MeetingPoint` instances. In order for all three entities to become a single composition and be edited together, the following should be done in addition to the steps described above:

* {proj_model}/blob/master/modules/global/src/com/company/sample/entity/airports/Terminal.java[Terminal.java] - the `meetingPoints` attribute of the `Terminal` class is marked as `@Composition` and `@OnDelete` similarly to the `terminals` attribute of the `Airport` class.

* {proj_model}/blob/master/modules/global/src/com/company/sample/views.xml[views.xml] - the `terminal-meetingPoints-view` view of the `Terminal` class contains the `meetingPoints` collection attribute. This view is used in the `airport-terminals-meetingPoints-view` view of the `Airport` entity.

* {proj_model}/blob/master/modules/web/src/com/company/sample/web/airports_1/airport/airport-edit.xml[airport-edit.xml] - the `Airport` edit screen XML descriptor contains datasources for an instance of the `Airport` and nested entities for the entire composition (`airportDs` > `terminalsDs` > `meetingPointsDs`).

Here, the `meetingPointsDs` datasource is not associated with any visual components, however it is needed for correct operation of joint editing of the composition.

* {proj_model}/blob/master/modules/web/src/com/company/sample/web/airports_1/terminal/terminal-edit.xml[terminal-edit.xml] - the terminal edit screen XML descriptor contains a nested datasource and a corresponding table for the `meetingPoints` collection.

As a result, the updated instances of the `MeetingPoint`, as well as the `Terminal` instances, will be saved to the database only with the `Airport` instance in the same transaction.

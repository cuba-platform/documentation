== Working with Databases

This section provides practical advice on working with databases during application development and in production.

For information on configuration parameters for working with particular DBMS, see the <<dbms>> section.

[[db_update_in_dev]]
=== Creating the DB Schema

In the process of application development, you need to create and maintain the database schema that corresponds to the model entities. The platform offers an approach based on <<db_scripts,DB create and update scripts>> to solve this task. The practical steps to apply this approach are provided below.

The task to create and maintain the DB schema consists of two parts: creating the scripts and executing them.

Scripts can be created both manually and using Studio. The process of creating scripts in Studio is provided below. Run the *Generate DB scripts* command in the *Entities* section. In this case, Studio will connect to the database defined on the *Project properties* page and compare the available DB schema with the current data model.

If the database does not exist or does not have *SYS_DB_CHANGELOG* and *SEC_USER* tables, the system generates only DB initialization scripts. Otherwise, update scripts are created as well. Then, a page with the generated scripts is opened.

Update scripts are displayed on the *Update scripts* tab. Scripts with the *new* status reflect the difference between the current state of the data model and the DB schema. A separate script is created for each new or modified table. Some scripts also contain sets of referential integrity constraints. When the page is closed by clicking *OK*, the scripts are saved in the `db/update/{db_type}` directory of the *core* module.

Scripts that exist in the project and have been applied to the DB before are displayed with the *applied* status. They cannot be edited or removed.

The *Update scripts* tab can also display scripts with *to be deleted* status. These are the scripts available in the project, but not applied to the DB yet. These scripts are removed when you close the page by clicking OK. This is the standard behavior in case the scripts are created during previous scripts generation, but not applied by invoking *Update database*. In this case, you don't need them any longer, because the current difference between the DB schema and the data model is reflected in newly generated scripts. However, if the scripts were authored by another developer and retrieved from a version control system, you should cancel the saving and apply the other party's scripts to your DB first, and then generate new ones.

The *Init tables*, *Init constraints* and *Init data* tabs display DB create scripts that are located in the `db/init/{db_type}` directory of the *core* module.

The *Init tables* tab displays the `10.create-db.sql` script that creates the tables. The code related to one and the same table is separated by `++begin {table_name} ... end {table_name}++` comments. When an entity in the model is changed, Studio will replace code only for the corresponding table between the comments, while leaving the rest of the code, where manual changes could have been made, untouched. Therefore, do not remove these comments when editing the code manually, otherwise, Studio will not be able to properly apply the changes to the existing files.

The *Init constraints* tab displays the `20.create-db.sql` script that creates integrity constraints. It also has table-separating comments that you should not remove.

The *Init data* tab displays the `30.create-db.sql` script designed to provide additional information when initializing the DB. These may be, for example, functions, triggers or DML operators to fill the database with the necessary data. The contents of this script are created manually, if necessary.

[TIP]
====
At the initial stage of application development, when the data model is being actively changed, we recommend using only the DB creation scripts (located in the *Init tables*, *Init constraints*, *Init data*) tabs) and removing the update scripts in the *Update scripts* tab immediately after invoking the *Generate DB scripts* command. This is the most simple and reliable way to keep the DB up to date. Of course, it has a major drawback, since applying these scripts recreates the DB from scratch, and all data are lost. You can partially compensate this drawback at the development stage by adding commands to the *Init data* script that will create primary data upon initialization.

Update scripts become a convenient and necessary tool for developing and maintaining the DB at a later stage, when the data model is relatively stable, and the development and production databases have the data that can not be lost as a result of recreating the DB from scratch.
====

Use <<db_update_gradle,DB script execution by Gradle tasks>> to apply scripts: invoke *Run* > *Create database* to recreate the database and *Run* > *Update database* to apply the scripts. Please note that these items are available only if the application server is stopped. Of course, you can invoke the corresponding Gradle tasks (`createDb` and `updateDb`) at any time from the command line, but if the database or any of its objects are locked, script execution may fail.

[[db_mssql_features]]
=== MS SQL Server Specifics

*Microsoft SQL Server* uses cluster indexes for tables.

By default, a clustered index is based on the table's primary key, however, keys of the `UUID` type used by CUBA applications are poorly suited for clustered indexes. We recommend creating UUID primary keys with the `nonclustered` modificator:

[source, sql]
----
create table SALES_CUSTOMER (
    ID uniqueidentifier not null,
    CREATE_TS datetime,
    ...
    primary key nonclustered (ID)
)^
----

[[db_oracle_features]]
=== Oracle Database Specifics

Due to the distribution policy of Oracle JDBC driver, it can only be downloaded manually from http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/database/features/jdbc/index-091264.html.

After downloading, copy the `ojdbc6.jar` file to the `lib` subdirectory of the CUBA Studio installation path and to the `lib` subdirectory of the installed Tomcat server. Then stop Studio, stop Gradle daemon by executing

[source, plain]
----
gradle --stop
----

in the command line, then start Studio again.

For SE version, copy the JAR file to the `~/.haulmont/studio/lib/` directory and to the `lib` subdirectory of the installed Tomcat server.

[[db_mysql_features]]
=== MySQL Database Specifics

The MySQL JDBC driver is not distributed with CUBA Studio due to the license restrictions, so you should do the following:

* Download the driver archive from https://dev.mysql.com/downloads/connector/j

* Extract JAR file and rename it to `mysql-connector-java.jar`

* Copy the JAR file to the `~/.haulmont/studio/lib/` directory and to the `lib` subdirectory of the installed Tomcat server

* Stop Studio and Gradle daemon by executing `gradle --stop` in the command line, then start Studio again

MySQL does not support partial indexes, so the only way to implement a unique constraint for a <<soft_deletion,soft deleted>> entity is to use the `DELETE_TS` column in the index. But there is another problem: MySQL allows multiple NULLs in a column with a unique constraint. Since the standard `DELETE_TS` column is nullable, it cannot be used in the unique index. We recommend the following workaround for creating unique constraints for soft deleted entities:

. Create a `DELETE_TS_NN` column in the database table. This column is not null and is initialized by a default value:
+
[source, sql]
----
create table DEMO_CUSTOMER (
    ...
    DELETE_TS_NN datetime(3) not null default '1000-01-01 00:00:00.000',
    ...
)
----

. Create a trigger that will change `DELETE_TS_NN` value when `DELETE_TS` value is changed:
+
[source, sql]
----
create trigger DEMO_CUSTOMER_DELETE_TS_NN_TRIGGER before update on DEMO_CUSTOMER
for each row
    if not(NEW.DELETE_TS <=> OLD.DELETE_TS) then
        set NEW.DELETE_TS_NN = if (NEW.DELETE_TS is null, '1000-01-01 00:00:00.000', NEW.DELETE_TS);
    end if
----

. Create a unique index including unique columns and `DELETE_TS_NN`:
+
[source, sql]
----
create unique index IDX_DEMO_CUSTOMER_UNIQ_NAME on DEMO_CUSTOMER (NAME, DELETE_TS_NN)
----

[[db_schema_connection]]
=== Connecting to a Non-Default Database Schema

PostgreSQL and Microsoft SQL Server support connection to a specific database schema. By default, the schema is `public` on PostgreSQL and `dbo` on SQL Server.

*PostgreSQL*

In order to use non-default schema on PostgreSQL, specify the `currentSchema` parameter in the `connectionParams` property of the <<build.gradle_createDb,createDb>> and <<build.gradle_updateDb,updateDb>> Gradle tasks, for example:

[source, groovy]
----
include::{sourcesdir}/database/db_schema_connection_1.groovy[]
----

If you are using Studio, add this connection parameter to the *Connection params* field on the *Project properties* page. Studio will update `build.gradle` automatically. After that, you can update or re-create the database, and all tables will be created in the specified schema.

*Microsoft SQL Server*

On Microsoft SQL Server, providing a connection property is not enough, you have to link the schema with the database user. Below is an example of creating a new database and using a non-default schema in it.

* Create a login:
+
[source, sql]
----
create login JohnDoe with password='saPass1'
----

* Create a new database:
+
[source, sql]
----
create database my_db
----

* Connect to the new database as `sa`, create a schema, then create a user and give him owner rights:
+
[source, sql]
----
create schema my_schema

create user JohnDoe for login JohnDoe with default_schema = my_schema

exec sp_addrolemember 'db_owner', 'JohnDoe'
----

Now you should specify the `currentSchema` parameter in the `connectionParams` property of the <<build.gradle_updateDb,updateDb>> Gradle task (or in Studio project properties). In fact, this property is not handled by SQL Server JDBC driver, but it tells Studio and CUBA Gradle plugin what schema to use.

[source, groovy]
----
include::{sourcesdir}/database/db_schema_connection_2.groovy[]
----

Keep in mind, that you cannot re-create the SQL Server database from Studio or by executing `createDb` in the command line, because non-default schema requires association with a user. But if you run *Update database* in Studio or `updateDb` in the command line, all required tables will be created in the existing database and specified schema.

[[db_update_in_prod]]
=== Creating and Updating the Database in Production

This section describes different ways of creating and updating a database during application deployment and operation. To learn more about the structure and the rules of database scripts, please see <<db_scripts,>> and <<db_update_in_dev,>>.

[[db_update_in_prod_by_server]]
==== Execution of Database Scripts by Server

<<db_update_server,The execution of DB scripts by server>> mechanism can be used for both database initialization and its further update during the application development and data schema modification.

The following actions should be completed to initialize a new database:

* Enable the <<cuba.automaticDatabaseUpdate,cuba.automaticDatabaseUpdate>> application property by adding the following line to the <<app_properties_files,local.app.properties>> file of the Middleware block:
+
[source, properties]
----
cuba.automaticDatabaseUpdate = true
----
+
For <<fast_deployment,fast deployment>> to Tomcat, this file is located in the `tomcat/conf/app-core` directory. If the file does not exist, create it.

* Create an empty database corresponding to the URL specified in the data source description in <<context.xml,context.xml>>.

* Start the application server containing the Middleware block. At application start, the database will be initialized and ready for work.

After that, each time when the application server starts, a scripts execution mechanism will compare the set of scripts located in the <<db_dir,database scripts directory>> with the list of already executed scripts registered in the database. If new scripts are found, they will be executed and registered as well. Typically it is enough to include the update scripts in each new application version, and the database will be actualized each time when the application server is restarted.

When using the database scripts execution mechanism at server start, the following should be considered:

* If any error occurs when running a script, the Middleware block stops initialization and becomes inoperable. The client blocks generate messages about inability to connect to the Middleware.
+
Check the app.log file located in <<log_dir,the server's log folder>> for a message about SQL execution from the `com.haulmont.cuba.core.sys.DbUpdaterEngine` logger and, possibly, further error messages to identify the error reasons.

* The update scripts, as well as the DDL and the SQL commands within the scripts separated with `"^"`, are executed in separate transactions. That is why when an update fails there is still a big chance that a part of the scripts or even individual commands of the last script will have been executed and committed to the database.
+
With this in mind, creating a backup copy of the database immediately before starting the server is highly recommended. Then, when the error reason is fixed, the database can be restored and the automatic process restarted.
+
If the backup is missing, you should identify which part of the script was executed and committed after the error is fixed. If the entire script failed to execute, the automatic process can be simply restarted. If some of the commands before the erroneous one were separated with the `"^"` character, executed in a separate transaction and committed, then the remaining part of the commands should be run and this script should be registered in *SYS_DB_CHANGELOG* manually. After that, the server can be started and the automatic update mechanism will start processing the next unexecuted script.
+
CUBA Studio generates update scripts with ";" delimiter for all database types except Oracle. If update script commands are separated by semicolons, the script is executed in one transaction and entirely rolled back in case of failure. This behavior ensures consistency between the database schema and the list of executed update scripts.

[[db_update_in_prod_cmdline]]
==== Initializing and Updating a Database from The Command Line

Database create and update scripts can be run from the command line using the `com.haulmont.cuba.core.sys.utils.DbUpdaterUtil` class included in the platform's Middleware block. At startup, the following arguments should be specified:

* `dbType` – <<dbms_types,DBMS type>>, possible values: postgres, mssql, oracle, mysql.

* `dbVersion` – <<dbms_version,DBMS version>> (optional argument).

* `dbDriver` - JDBC driver class name (optional argument). If not provided, the driver class name will be derived from `dbType`.

* `dbUser` – database user name.

* `dbPassword` – database user password.

* `dbUrl` – database connection URL. For primary initialization, the specified database should be empty; the database is not cleared automatically in advance.

* `scriptsDir` – absolute path to the folder containing scripts in the standard structure. Typically, this is the <<db_dir,database scripts directory>> supplied with the application.

* one of the possible commands:

** `create` – initialize the database.

** `check` – show all unexecuted update scripts.

** `update` – update the database.

An example of a script for Linux running `DbUpdaterUtil`:

[source, bash]
----
include::{sourcesdir}/database/dbupdate.sh[]
----

This script is designed to work with the database named `mydb` running on the local *PostgreSQL* server. The script should be located in the `bin` folder of the Tomcat server and should be started with `{username}`, `{password}` and `{command}`, for example:

[source]
----
./dbupdate.sh cuba cuba123 update
----

Script execution progress is displayed in the console. If any error occurs, same actions as described in the previous section for the automatic update mechanism should be performed.

[WARNING]
====
When updating the database from the command line, the existing Groovy scripts are started, but only their main part gets executed. Due to the lack of the server context, the script's `PostUpdate` part is ignored with the corresponding message written to the console.
====

[[db_hsql_connect]]
=== Connecting to HSQLDB with Squirrel SQL

*HSQLDB*, also called *HyperSQL*, is a convenient DBMS for application prototyping that does not require installation and is started automatically within CUBA Studio if the project has been configured to work with this DBMS. This section describes the way of connecting to HSQLDB with an external tool that allows working with DB schema and data directly via SQL.

*SQuirreL SQL Client* is an open-source Java application that enables working with databases via JDBC. You can download Squirrel SQL here: http://squirrel-sql.sourceforge.net.

Before starting *Squirrel SQL*, find the `hsqldb-x.x.x.jar` file in the `lib` folder of your *CUBA Studio* installation and copy it to the `lib` folder of *Squirrel SQL*.

Start *Squirrel SQL* and go to *Drivers*. Make sure that *HSQLDB Server* driver is active.

Open *Aliases* tab and click the *Create a new Alias* button.

Fill in the connection properties in the window that appears: Database URL, User Name and Password. The default user name is "sa", the password is empty. The database URL can be copied from the *Project properties* tab in CUBA Studio, or from the `modules/core/web/META-INF/context.xml` file of the application project.

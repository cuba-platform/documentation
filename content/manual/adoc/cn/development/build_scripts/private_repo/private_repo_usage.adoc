===== Using the Private Repository

Now your private repository is ready to use. Find the *cuba-group* URL at the top of the screen, for example:
----
http://localhost:8081/nexus/content/groups/cuba-group
----

- If you are creating a new project, click the button next to the *Repository* field in the *New project* window.
- For an existing project, edit *Project properties* and click the button next to the *Repository* field.
- In the opened dialog, click *Add*, enter the repository URL and credentials: `admin / admin123`.
- Select the new repository and click *OK* to use it in the project.
- Save the *Project properties* page.
- Build the project.

During the first build your new repository downloads necessary artifacts and keeps them in the cache for the next usage. You may find them in `c:\nexus-2.14.3-02\sonatype-work` folder.

====== Use of Soft Deletion

To support soft deletion, the entity class should implement `SoftDelete` interface, and the corresponding database table should contain the following columns:

* `DELETE_TS` – when the record was deleted.

* `DELETED_BY` – the login of the user who deleted the record.

The default behavior for instances implementing `SoftDelete` interface, is that soft deleted entities are not returned by queries or search by id. If required, this behavior can by dynamically turned off using the following methods:

* Calling `setSoftDeletion(false)` for the current <<entityManager,EntityManager>> instance.

* Calling `setSoftDeletion(false)` for `LoadContext` object when requesting data via <<dataManager,DataManager>>.

* On the <<datasources,datasource>> level – calling `CollectionDatasource.setSoftDeletion(false)` or setting `softDeletion="false"` attribute of `collectionDatasource` element in the screen's <<screen_xml,XML-descriptor>>.

In soft deletion mode, the platform automatically filters out the deleted instances when loading by identifier and when using <<jpql, JPQL queries>>, as well as the deleted elements of the related entities in collection attributes. However, related entities in single-value (*ToOne) attributes are loaded, regardless of whether the related instance was deleted or not.

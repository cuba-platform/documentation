===== Using Native Polymer Tools

You can use native Polymer framework toolchain when developing Polymer UI components. It can be convenient if a separate team of front-end developers works on the project. In this case, `Node.js` should be installed on the system.

Install `bower` and `polymer-cli` globally:

[source]
----
npm install bower polymer-cli -g
----

Then you can build and run the web application without Gradle:

[source]
----
cd modules/polymer-client
npm install
bower install
polymer serve
----

You need to specify the absolute path to REST API in `modules/polymer-client/index.html` if you want to serve the app by polymer server (instead of Tomcat), e.g.:

[source,html]
----
<myapp-shell api-url="http://localhost:8080/app/rest/"></myapp-shell>
----

After that, the web application will be available at `++http://localhost:8081++` (see the particular port in command line output) and it will work with the REST API running at `++http://localhost:8080/app/rest/++`.

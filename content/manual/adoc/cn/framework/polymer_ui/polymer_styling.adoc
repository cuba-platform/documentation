==== Styling

See the Polymer's https://www.polymer-project.org/2.0/docs/devguide/style-shadow-dom[styling guide]. The most noticeable difference between traditional approach is how global styles are specified.
Since Polymer elements use Shadow DOM global styles do not leak inside the components. You need to use https://www.polymer-project.org/2.0/docs/devguide/style-shadow-dom#style-modules[style-modules] instead. There is a `shares-styles.html` file in Polymer client which is automatically being imported to any new component created in Studio.

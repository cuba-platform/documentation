[[rest_api_v2]]
=== REST API

The universal REST API provides the following functionality:

* CRUD operations on entities.
* Execution of predefined JPQL queries.
* Execution of service methods.
* Getting metadata (entities, views, enumerations, datatypes).
* Getting current user permissions (access to entities, attributes, specific permissions).
* Getting current user information (name, language, time zone, etc.).
* Uploading and downloading files.

REST API uses the OAuth2 protocol for authentication and supports anonymous access.

[TIP]
====
The detailed documentation for the API is written according to http://swagger.io/specification[Swagger specification] and is available at the following URL: {rest_swagger_url}.

Also, any running CUBA application exports the project-specific documentation, see <<rest_swagger,>>.
====

The <<rest_api_v2_usage_example>> cookbook section contains a lot of examples demonstrating REST API features in action.

Below we provide a formal description of some features and configuration options.

[[rest_api_v2_queries_config]]
==== Predefined JPQL Queries Configuration

In the CUBA application, predefined JPQL queries must be specified in files registered in the <<cuba.rest.queriesConfig, cuba.rest.queriesConfig>> application property of the *web* or *portal* module (e.g in the `web-app.properties file`):

[source,properties]
----
cuba.rest.queriesConfig = +com/company/myapp/rest-queries.xml
----

The `rest-queries.xml` file must be placed in the root package of the *web* or *portal* module (e.g. `com.company.myapp`). Its content is defined by the http://schemas.haulmont.com/cuba/{revnumber}/rest-queries.xsd[rest-queries.xsd] schema, for example:

[source, xml]
----
include::{sourcesdir}/rest/rest-queries-config.xml[]
----

An example of how to configure and execute a query can be found in the <<rest_api_v2_ex_query_get>> and <<rest_api_v2_ex_query_post>> chapter.

The platform also provides the predefined `all` query for getting all instances of a specified entity type. It can be used with `/count` to receive the total number of entity instances, for example:

  http://localhost:8080/app/rest/v2/queries/sales$Order/all/count

The `query` element can have the `cacheable` attribute that enables <<entity_cache,caching>> of the query.

A query can contain predefined parameters that take the values of the current user id and login: `session$userId` and `session$userLogin`. You don't have to declare them in the `params` element (see the example above).

[[rest_api_v2_services_config]]
==== Services Configuration

The list of service methods that are available via the REST API must be configured in the CUBA application in files registered in the <<cuba.rest.servicesConfig, cuba.rest.servicesConfig>> application property of the *web* or *portal* module (e.g in the `web-app.properties file`):

[source,properties]
----
cuba.rest.servicesConfig = +com/company/myapp/rest-services.xml
----

The content of the `rest-services.xml` must be placed in the root package of the *web* or *portal* module (e.g. `com.company.myapp`). Its content is defined by the http://schemas.haulmont.com/cuba/{revnumber}/rest-services-v2.xsd[rest-services-v2.xsd] schema, for example:

[source, xml]
----
include::{sourcesdir}/rest/rest-services-config.xml[]
----

Method parameter types can be omitted if the service doesn't contain an overloaded method with the same number of parameters. Otherwise, types must be defined.

An example of how to configure and invoke a service can be found in the <<rest_api_v2_ex_service_get>> chapter.

[[rest_api_v2_data_model_versioning]]
==== Data Model Versioning

REST API can handle data model changes. It is useful when, for example, some entity attribute was renamed, but REST API client doesn't know about this modification and expects the attribute to have an old name.

For such cases REST API allows you to define transformation rules for entities JSON. If the client application sends the data model version in the request query parameter then the JSON in REST API method response or request body will be transformed according to transformation rules defined for that particular domain model version.

JSON transformation rules must be specified in files registered in <<cuba.rest.jsonTransformationConfig, cuba.rest.jsonTransformationConfig>> application property of the *web* or *portal* module (e.g in the `web-app.properties` file):

[source,properties]
----
cuba.rest.jsonTransformationConfig = +com/company/myapp/rest-json-transformations.xml
----

The `rest-json-transformations.xml` file must be placed in the *web* or *portal* module (e.g. in package `com.company.myapp`). Its content is defined by the {xsd_url}/rest-json-transformations.xsd[rest-json-transformations.xsd] schema. File example:

[source, xml]
----
include::{sourcesdir}/rest/rest-json-transformations.xml[]
----

Standard transformers configured in the config file can perform the following transformations of entity JSON:

* rename entity

* rename entity attribute

* remove entity attribute

JSON transformation works for the following REST API endpoints:

* */entities* - getting entities list, getting a single entity, entity create, entity update, entity delete

* */queries* - entities JSON returned by the query will be transformed

* */services* - JSON transformations will be applied both to entities returned by the service method and to entities passed as a service method argument

JSON transformations are applied if the request to the REST API contains the `modelVersion` URL parameter with the data model version number.

See the <<rest_api_v2_ex_json_transformations>> to understand how to configure data model versioning and use it from the client application.

[[rest_api_v2_cors]]
==== CORS Settings

By default, all CORS requests to the REST API are allowed. To restrict the origins list you can define the <<cuba.rest.allowedOrigins, cuba.rest.allowedOrigins>> application property.

[[rest_api_v2_anonymous]]
==== Anonymous Access

By default, anonymous access is disabled. To enable it, use the <<cuba.rest.anonymousEnabled, cuba.rest.anonymousEnabled>> application property. A request is considered to be anonymous if it doesn't contain an `Authentication` header. In this case, the <<securityContext, SecurityContext>> will contain an anonymous user session.

To set up permissions for anonymous user you must define <<roles, roles>> for the user specified by the <<cuba.anonymousLogin, cuba.anonymousLogin>> application property.

[[rest_api_v2_settings]]
==== Other REST API Settings

<<cuba.rest.client.id, cuba.rest.client.id>> - defines a default REST API client id.

<<cuba.rest.client.secret, cuba.rest.client.secret>> - defines a default REST API client secret.

<<cuba.rest.client.tokenExpirationTimeSec, cuba.rest.client.tokenExpirationTimeSec>> - defines an access token expiration time for the default client in seconds.

<<cuba.rest.client.refreshTokenExpirationTimeSec, cuba.rest.client.refreshTokenExpirationTimeSec>> - defines a refresh token expiration time for the default client in seconds.

<<cuba.rest.client.authorizedGrantTypes, cuba.rest.client.authorizedGrantTypes>> - a list of authorized grant types for the default client. To disable refresh tokens remove the `refresh_token` item from the property value.

<<cuba.rest.maxUploadSize, cuba.rest.maxUploadSize>> - defines a maximum file size that can be uploaded with the REST API.

<<cuba.rest.reuseRefreshToken, cuba.rest.reuseRefreshToken>> - specifies whether a refresh token should be reused.

<<cuba.rest.requiresSecurityToken,cuba.rest.requiresSecurityToken>> - indicates that additional system attribute must be sent in JSON. See details in <<rest_api_v2_security_constraints>>.

<<cuba.rest.tokenMaskingEnabled,cuba.rest.tokenMaskingEnabled>> - specifies whether REST API token values should be masked in application logs.

[[rest_api_v2_custom_controllers]]
==== Creating Custom OAuth2 Protected Controllers

If you need to create a custom REST controller protected with the OAuth2 authentication then you have to do the following:

. Suppose you have the following REST controller:
+
[source, java]
----
include::{sourcesdir}/features/MyController.java[]
----

. Create a new Spring configuration file with name `rest-dispatcher-spring.xml` under the root package (`com.company.test`) of *web* or *portal* module. The content of the file must be as follows:
+
[source, xml]
----
include::{sourcesdir}/rest/rest-dispatcher-spring.xml[]
----

. Define an <<additive_app_properties,additive>> application property `cuba.restSpringContextConfig` in the properties file of the module,.e.g. `portal-app.properties`:
+
[source, properties]
----
cuba.restSpringContextConfig = +com/company/test/rest-dispatcher-spring.xml
----

. The new controller runs in the context of the `CubaRestApiServlet`. So the URL for controller methods will start with the `/rest`, i.e. the doSmth() method will be accesed by the URL: `\http://localhost:8080/app-portal/rest/myapi/dosmth`.
+
[WARNING]
====
URL of the custom controller MUST NOT start with the `/rest/v2`.
====

[[rest_api_v2_security_constraints]]
==== Security Constraints for Collection Attributes

Let's consider the following situation:

* Your data model contains `Order` and `OrderLine` entities which form the one-to-many composition.

* Your REST client loads an instance of `Order` together with the nested collection of `OrderLine` instances.

* There are <<constraints,security constraints>> that filter out some `OrderLine` instances, so the client does not load them and doesn't know they exist. Say `line5` is not loaded by the client but exists in the database.

* If your client removes, say, `line2` from the collection and then saves the whole composition using the `/entities/{entityName}/{entityId}` endpoint, there are two outcomes:
+
--
. If the constraints were not changed since the entities were loaded, the framework restores the filtered `line5` instance in the collection and deletes only `line2`, which is the correct behavior.

. If the constraints were changed in a way that `line5` is now available to the client, the framework cannot restore the information about filtered collection elements correctly. As a result, both `line2` and `line5` will be deleted.
--

If you are concerned with the case described above, you can eliminate possible data loss by sending a special system attribute in the JSON representing your entities. This attribute is called `+__securityToken+` and automatically included in resulting JSON if the <<cuba.rest.requiresSecurityToken,cuba.rest.requiresSecurityToken>> application property is set to `true`. The responsibility of your REST client is to return this attribute back when saving entities.

An example of entity JSON including security token:

[source, json]
----
include::{sourcesdir}/features/securityToken.json[]
----

The `+__securityToken+` attribute contains encoded identifiers of filtered instances, so the framework can always restore the required information regardless of changes in constraints.

[[rest_api_v2_persistent_token_store]]
==== Persistent Token Store

By default, OAuth tokens are stored in memory only. If you want to persist them in the database as well, you should set the <<cuba.rest.storeTokensInDb,cuba.rest.storeTokensInDb>> application property to `true`. The property value is stored in the database, so you can change its value in the *Administration > Application Properties* screen.

Expired tokens in the database store must be periodically deleted. The cron expression for scheduled removing of expired tokens is specified in the <<cuba.rest.deleteExpiredTokensCron,cuba.rest.deleteExpiredTokensCron>> application property.

[[rest_swagger]]
==== OpenAPI (Swagger) Documentation

The generic documentation on the REST API is available at {rest_swagger_url}.

Any running CUBA application also exports the project-specific documentation generated according to the https://swagger.io/docs/specification/2-0/basic-structure/[Swagger specification version 2.0].

The documentation is available at the following URLs:

* `/rest/v2/docs/swagger.yaml` - YAML version of generic documentation.

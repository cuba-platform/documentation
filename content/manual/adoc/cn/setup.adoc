[[setup]]
== Installation and Setup

Minimum software requirements are as follows:

Java SE Development Kit (JDK) 8::
+
--
Install JDK 8 and check it by running the following command in the console:

`java -version`

The command should return the Java version, e.g. `++1.8.0_152++`.

[WARNING]
====
Java 9 is not supported yet. You can build and run CUBA applications only on Java 8.
====

In order to build and run projects outside Studio, you need to set the path to the JDK root directory in the `++JAVA_HOME++` environment variable, e.g. `++C:\Program Files\Java\jdk1.8.0_152++`.

* On *Windows*, you can do this at *Computer* -> *Properties* -> *Advanced System Settings* -> *Advanced* -> *Environment variables*. The value of the variable should be added to the *System variables* list.

* On *macOS*, it is recommended to set `JAVA_HOME` in `~/.bash_profile`:
+
`export JAVA_HOME=$(/usr/libexec/java_home -v 1.8)`
+
If you install Java 9 on macOS, CUBA Studio and applications won't start, regardless of the `JAVA_HOME` value. In this case, see the <<setup_troubleshooting, troubleshooting>> section below.
--

Java IDE::
+
--
*IntelliJ IDEA* or *Eclipse*. We recommend using *IntelliJ IDEA* (Community or Ultimate).
--

Database::
+
--
In the most basic scenario, the built-in *HyperSQL* (link:$$http://hsqldb.org$$[http://hsqldb.org]) can be used as the database server. This is sufficient for exploring the platform capabilities and application prototyping. For building production applications, it is recommended to install and use one of the full-featured DBMS <<dbms_types,supported by the platform>>, like *PostgreSQL* for instance.
--

Web browser::
+
--
The web interface of the platform-based applications supports all popular browsers, including *Google Chrome*, *Mozilla Firefox*, *Safari*, *Opera 15+*, *Internet Explorer 9+*, *Microsoft Edge*.
--

[[setup_troubleshooting]]
Troubleshooting::
+
--
. If you install Java 9 on macOS for some reason, CUBA Studio and applications won't start. To recover from this situation, do the following:

.. Make you JDK 9 installation not used by default throughout the system: rename `/Library/Java/JavaVirtualMachines/jdk-9.0.1.jdk/Contents/Info.plist` file into `Info.plist.disabled` (replace `jdk-9.0.1.jdk` with the actual version of your JDK 9).

.. Replace `JavaAppletPlugin.plugin` installed by Java 9 to the one from Java 8:
*** Remove or rename `/Library/Internet Plug-Ins/JavaAppletPlugin.plugin`
*** Install JDK 8 again, it will re-create the plugin.

.. Make sure you have specified `JAVA_HOME` with `-v 1.8` argument as shown above. Re-login or `source .bash_profile` after making changes.

. Make sure your environment does not contain `CATALINA_HOME`, `CATALINA_BASE` and `CLASSPATH` variables. They may cause problems starting *Apache Tomcat* web server which is used at development time. Reboot your computer after removing the variables.

[[cubaStudio_install]]
=== CUBA Studio Installation

Prerequisites::
+
--
* Make sure that Java SE Development Kit (JDK) 8 is <<setup,installed>> by running the following command in the console:
+
`java -version`
+
The command should return the Java version, e.g. `++1.8.0_152++`.

* If you are using OpenJDK on Linux, install http://openjdk.java.net/projects/openjfx/[OpenJFX], for example:
+
`sudo apt-get install openjfx`

* If you connect to the internet via a proxy server, some Java system properties must be passed to the JVM running Studio and Gradle. These properties are explained here: http://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/docs/technotes/guides/net/proxies.html (see properties for HTTP and HTTPS protocols).
+
It is recommended to set these properties system-wide in the `++JAVA_OPTS++` environment variable. The Studio launch script passes `++JAVA_OPTS++` to the Java executable.
--

Fresh installation of CUBA Studio::
+
. Download an appropriate installer or ZIP archive from https://www.cuba-platform.com/download.
+
. Run the installer or unzip the archive to a local directory, e.g. `c:\work\studio`.
+
. Launch the installed application or open the command line, go to `bin` directory and run `studio.bat` or `studio` depending on your operating system.
+
. In the *CUBA Studio Server* window, enter the following parameters:
+
--
* *Server port* − CUBA Studio server port (the default port is 8111).

* *Remote connection* - by default, Studio accepts connections only from localhost. Select this checkbox if you need to connect to this Studio instance from a remote host.

* *Silent startup* - if selected, the Studio server starts in tray and opens UI in default browser automatically. This option is available only for Windows.

--
+
. Click *Start* to run the Studio server.
+
When the web server is started, the URL of the Studio interface will appear in the *URL* field. By clicking *->*, you can open the address in your default web browser; by clicking *Copy* you can copy the address to the clipboard.
+
. Open the specified URL in the web browser and switch to the *Settings* tab in the Studio web interface. Enter the following parameters:
+
--
* *Java home* − JDK installation to be used for building and running projects. If you have set the `++JAVA_HOME++` environment variable as described in the <<setup,beginning>> of this chapter, it will appear in this field. Otherwise, Studio will try to find your Java installation itself.

* *Gradle home* - Gradle installation to be used for building projects. Leave it empty; in this case, the required Gradle distribution will be downloaded automatically.
+
If you want to use a local Gradle distribution, enter a path to the respective directory. Current version of the project build system is tested with *Gradle {gradleVersion}*.

* *IDE port* − IDE plugin listening port (the default port is 48561).

* *Offline* - enable working with projects without an Internet connection, provided that all the required libraries have been previously downloaded from the repository.

* *Check for updates* - check for new versions on every start.

* *Send anonymous statistics and crash reports* - enable Studio to send error statistics to developers.

* *Help language* - built-in help language.

* *Logging level* -  the logging level: TRACE, DEBUG, INFO, WARN, ERROR, or FATAL. INFO by default.

+
. Click *Apply and proceed to projects*.
+
. Click *Create new* to create a new project, or *Import* to add an existing one to the *Recent* list.
+
. Once the project is opened, the Studio will download the source code of the platform components and save it to the local folder. Before building the project, it is recommended to wait until the download is finished and make sure that the background task indicator in the bottom left corner has faded out.

Updating CUBA Studio::
+
--
If you are updating Studio to a newer bug-fix version (e.g. from 6.5.0 to 6.5.1), install it to the existing folder, e.g. on Windows it would be `C:\Program Files (x86)\CUBA Studio 6.5`. When installing a new minor or major version, use a separate folder, e.g. `CUBA Studio 6.6`.

If installed from Windows EXE installer or ZIP archive, Studio supports auto-update on newer bug-fix releases. Update files are saved in the `~/.haulmont/studio/update` folder. In case of any problems with the new version, you can remove the update files and Studio will revert to the version installed manually.

Auto-update does not work for minor and major releases and if Studio was installed from macOS DMG. In this case, you should download new installer and run it manually.

[[ide_integration]]
=== IDE Integration

Take the following steps to integrate Studio with *IntelliJ IDEA* or *Eclipse*:

. Open or <<qs_create_project,create a new>> project in the Studio.

. Switch to *Project properties* section and click *Edit*. Select the required *Java IDE* by checking *IntelliJ IDEA* or *Eclipse*.

. Select *Build* > *Create or update <IDE> project files* in the Studio menu. The corresponding files will be created in the project directory.

. For IntelliJ IDEA integration:

.. Run IntelliJ IDEA 13+ and install *CUBA Framework Integration* plugin, from the plugin repository: *File > Settings > Plugins > Browse Repositories*.

. For Eclipse integration:

.. Run Eclipse 4.3+, open *Help > Install New Software*, add `++http://files.cuba-platform.com/eclipse-update-site++` repository and install the *CUBA Plugin*.

.. In the *CUBA* section of the *Window > Preferences* menu, check *Studio Integration Enabled*, and click *OK*.

Please note that *IDE: on port 48561* label has appeared in the bottom left corner of the Studio. Now the corresponding source code files will be opened in IDE when you click *IDE* buttons in the Studio.

=== Architecture

This section covers the architecture of CUBA applications in different perspectives: by tiers, blocks, modules and components.

[[app_tiers]]
==== Application Tiers and Blocks

The platform enables building applications according to the classic three-tier pattern: client tier, middleware, database. The _tier_ indicates the degree of "remoteness" from the stored data.

Further on, mainly middleware and client tiers will be described, therefore the words "all tiers" will refer to these tiers only.

Each tier enables creating one or more application _blocks_. A block is a separate executable program interacting with other blocks in the application. CUBA platform tools enable creation of blocks in the form of web or desktop applications.

Middleware:: The middle tier contains core business logic of the application and provides access to the database. It is represented by a separate web application running on <<javaee_web_profile, Java EE Web Profile>> standard container. See <<middleware>>.

Web Client:: A main block of the client tier. It contains the interface designed primarily for internal users. It is represented by a separate web application running on Java EE Web Profile standard container. The user interface is implemented on the base of *Vaadin* framework. See <<gui_framework>>.

Desktop Client:: An additional block of the client tier. It contains the interface designed primarily for internal users. It is represented by a desktop Java application; the user interface is implemented on the base of *Java Swing* framework. See <<gui_framework>>.

Web Portal:: An additional block of the client tier. It can contain an interface for external users and entry points for integration with mobile devices and third-party applications. It is represented by a separate web application running on Java EE Web Profile standard container. The user interface is implemented on the base of *Spring MVC* framework. See <<portal>>.

Polymer Client:: An optional client designed for external users and written in pure JavaScript. It is based on https://www.polymer-project.org[Google Polymer] framework and communicates with the middleware via <<rest_api_v2,REST API>> running either in Web Client or in Web Portal blocks. See <<polymer_ui>>.

*Middleware* is the mandatory block for any application. User interface can be implemented by one or several blocks, such as *Web Client* and *Polymer Client*.

All of the Java-based client blocks interact with the middle tier uniformly via HTTP protocol enabling to deploy the middle tier arbitrarily, behind firewall as well. In the simplest case when the middle tier and the web client are deployed on the same server local interaction between them can bypass the network stack for better performance.

[[app_modules]]
==== Application Modules

A module is the smallest structural part of CUBA application. It is a single module of application project and the corresponding JAR file with executable code.

Standard modules:

* *global* – includes entity classes, service interfaces, and other classes common for all tiers. It is used in all <<app_tiers,application blocks>>.

* *core* – implements services and all other components of the middle tier. It is used only in *Middleware*.

* *gui* – common components of the <<gui_framework,generic user interface>>. It is used in *Web Client* and *Desktop Client*.

* *web* – the implementation of the generic user interface based on *Vaadin* and other specific web client classes. It is used in *Web Client* block.

* *desktop* – an optional module – implementation of generic user interface based on *Java Swing*, as well as other specific desktop client classes. It is used in *Desktop Client* block.

* *portal* – an optional module – implementation of Web portal based on *Spring MVC*.

* *polymer-client* – an optional module – implementation of <<polymer_ui>> in JavaScript.

[[app_components]]
==== Application Components

The functionality of the platform is divided into several _application components_ (aka _base projects_):

* *cuba* – the main component containing all of the functionality described in this manual.

* *reports* – reports generating subsystem.

* *fts* – full-text search subsystem.

* *charts* – subsystem for displaying charts and maps.

* *bpm* – the mechanism of business processes execution according to the BPMN 2.0 standard.

An application always project depends on one ore more application components. It means that the application uses the component as a library and includes its functionality.

Any CUBA application depends on the *cuba* component. Other platform components are optional and can be included to the application only if needed. All optional components depend on *cuba* and can also contain dependencies between each other.

Below is a diagramm showing dependencies between the platform application components. Solid lines demonstrate mandatory dependencies, dashed lines mean optional ones.

Any CUBA application can, in turn, be used as a component of another application. It enables decomposition of large projects to a set of functional modules, which can be developed independently. You can also create a set of custom application components in your organization and use them in multiple projects, effectively creating your own higher-level platform on top of CUBA. Below is an example of a possible structure of dependencies between application components.

image::AppComponents2.png[align="center"]

In order to be used as a component, an application project should contain an <<app-component.xml,app-component.xml>> descriptor and a special entry in the manifest of the *global* module JAR. CUBA Studio allows you to generate the descriptor and manifest entry for the current project automatically.

See step-by-step guide to working with a custom application component in the <<app_components_sample,>> section.

[[app_structure]]
==== Application Structure

The above-listed architectural principles are directly reflected in the composition of assembled application. Let us consider the example of a simple application *sales*, which has two blocks – *Middleware* and *Web Client*; and includes functionality of the two application components - *cuba* and *reports*.

.The structure of a simple application 
image::SampleAppArtifacts.png[align="center"]

The figure demonstrates the contents of several directories of the *Tomcat* server with a deployed application *sales* in it.

The *Middleware* <<app_tiers,block>> is represented by the `app-core` web application, the *Web Client* block – by the `app` web application. The executable code of the web applications can be found in directories `WEB-INF/lib` in sets of JAR files. Each JAR (<<artifact, artifact>>) is a result of assembly of one of the application or a <<app_components,component>> <<app_modules,modules>>.

For instance, the contents of JAR files of the web application in middle tier `app-core` is determined by the facts that the *Middleware* block includes *global* and *core* modules, and the application uses *cuba* and *reports* components.

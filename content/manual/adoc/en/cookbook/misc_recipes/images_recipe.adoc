==== Loading and Displaying Images

Let's consider a task of loading, storing and displaying employee photos:

* An employee is represented by `Employee` entity.

* Image files are stored in the <<file_storage,FileStorage>>. The `Employee` entity contains a link to the corresponding `FileDescriptor`.

* The `Employee` edit screen shows the picture and also supports uploading, downloading and clearing the picture.

Entity class with a link to the image file:

[source, java]
----
include::{sourcesdir}/cookbook/images_1.java[]
----

A <<views,view>> for loading an `Employee` together with `FileDescriptor` should include all local attributes of `FileDescriptor`:

[source, xml]
----
include::{sourcesdir}/cookbook/images_2.xml[]
----

A fragment of the `Employee` edit screen XML descriptor:

[source, xml]
----
include::{sourcesdir}/cookbook/images_3.xml[]
----

Components used to display, upload and download images are contained within the <<gui_GroupBoxLayout,groupBox>> container. Its top part shows a picture using the <<gui_Image,image>> component, while its bottom part from left to right contains the <<gui_FileUploadField,upload>> component and <<gui_Button,buttons>> to download and clear the image. As a result, this part of the screen should look like this:

Now, let us have a look at the <<abstractEditor,edit screen controller>>.

[source, java]
----
include::{sourcesdir}/cookbook/images.java[]
----

* The `init()` method first initializes the `uploadField` component that is used for uploading new images. In the case of a successful upload, a new `FileDescriptor` instance is retrieved from the component and the corresponding files are sent from the temporary client storage to `FileStorage` by invoking `FileUploadingAPI.putFileIntoStorage()`. After that, the `FileDescriptor` is saved to the database by invoking  <<dataSupplier,DataSupplier.commit()>>, and the saved instance is assigned to the `imageFile` attribute of the edited `Employee` entity. Then, the controller's `displayImage()` method is invoked to display the uploaded image.

After that, a listener is added in the `init()` method to the datasource containing an `Employee` instance. The listener enables or disables download and clear buttons, depending on the fact whether the file has been loaded or not.

* `postInit()` method performs file display and refreshes the button states, depending on the existence of a loaded file.

* `onDownloadImageBtnClick()` is invoked when the `downloadImageBtn` button is clicked; it downloads the file using the <<file_download,ExportDisplay>> interface.

* `onClearImageBtnClick()` is invoked when the `clearImageBtn` is clicked; it clears the `imageFile` attribute of the `Employee` entity. The file is not deleted from storage.

* `displayImage()` loads the file from storage and sets the content of the `image` component.

==== Getting Localized Messages

There are methods in the REST API for getting localized messages for entities, their properties and enums.

For example, to get a list of localized messages for the `sec$User` entity you have to execute the following *GET* request:

`\http://localhost:8080/app/rest/v2/messages/entities/sec$User`

An OAuth token must be put in the `Authorization` header with the `Bearer` type.

You can explicitly specify the desired locale using the *Accept-Language* http header.

The response will be like this:

[source, json]
----
include::{sourcesdir}/rest/rest-user-messages-response.json[]
----

To get the localization for enum, use the following URL:

`\http://localhost:8080/app/rest/v2/messages/enums/com.haulmont.cuba.security.entity.RoleType`

If you omit the entity name or enum name part in the URL, you'll get the localization for all entities or enums.

===== Creating Facebook Theme

Below is the example of creating a Halo-based Facebook theme, which resembles the interface of a popular social network.

. In CUBA Studio, open *Project Properties* section and click *Create custom theme*. Set the theme name - `facebook`, select `halo` as the base theme and click *Create*. The new theme directory will be created in the project:
+
[source, plain]
----
include::{sourcesdir}/gui/themes/themes_25.scss[]
----
+
The `styles.scss` file contains the list of your themes:
+
[source, css]
----
include::{sourcesdir}/gui/themes/themes_7.scss[]
----
+
The `facebook.scss` file:
+
[source, css]
----
include::{sourcesdir}/gui/themes/themes_8.scss[]
----
+
The `app-component.scss` file inside `com.haulmont.cuba`:
+
[source, css]
----
include::{sourcesdir}/gui/themes/themes_24.scss[]
----

. Modify the theme variables in `facebook-defaults.scss`. You can do it in Studio by clicking *Manage theme > Edit Facebook theme variables* or in IDE:
+
[source, css]
----
include::{sourcesdir}/gui/themes/themes_9.scss[]
----

. The `facebook-theme.properties` file in the `src` directory of the *web* module can be used to override the server-side theme variables from the `halo-theme.properties` file of the platform.

. The new theme has been automatically added to the `web-app.properties` file:
+
[source, properties]
----
cuba.web.theme = facebook
cuba.themeConfig = havana-theme.properties halo-theme.properties /com/company/application/web/facebook-theme.properties
----
+
The <<cuba.themeConfig,cuba.themeConfig>> property defines which themes will be available for the user in the *Settings* menu of an application.

. Rebuild the application and start the server. Now the user will see the application in Facebook theme on first login, and will be able to choose between Facebook, Halo and Havana in the *Help* > *Settings* menu.

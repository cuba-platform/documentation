=== MS SQL Server Specifics

*Microsoft SQL Server* uses cluster indexes for tables.

By default, a clustered index is based on the table's primary key, however, keys of the `UUID` type used by CUBA applications are poorly suited for clustered indexes. We recommend creating UUID primary keys with the `nonclustered` modificator:

[source, sql]
----
create table SALES_CUSTOMER (
    ID uniqueidentifier not null,
    CREATE_TS datetime,
    ...
    primary key nonclustered (ID)
)^
----

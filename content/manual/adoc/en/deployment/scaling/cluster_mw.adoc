Servers `host1` and `host2` host Tomcat instances with the `app` web application implementing the Web Client block. Cluster configuration for these servers is described in the <<cluster_webclient,previous section>>. Servers `host3` and `host4` host Tomcat instances with the `app-core` web application implementing the Middleware block. They are configured to interact and share information about user sessions, locks, cash flushes, etc.

In the examples below, we provide paths to configuration files as if <<fast_deployment>> is used.

===== Setting up Web Client Servers

[TIP]
====
In the examples below, we provide paths to configuration files as if <<fast_deployment>> is used.
====

On the Tomcat 1 and Tomcat 2 servers, the following settings should be applied:

. In `tomcat/conf/server.xml`, add the `jvmRoute` parameter equivalent to the name of the worker specified in the load balancer settings for `tomcat1` and `tomcat2`:
+
[source, xml]
----
<Server port="8005" shutdown="SHUTDOWN">
  ...
  <Service name="Catalina">
    ...
    <Engine name="Catalina" defaultHost="localhost" jvmRoute="tomcat1">
      ...
    </Engine>
  </Service>
</Server>
----

. Set the following application properties in `tomcat/conf/app/local.app.properties`:
+
[source, properties]
----
cuba.useLocalServiceInvocation = false
cuba.connectionUrlList = http://host3:8080/app-core

cuba.webHostName = host1
cuba.webPort = 8080
cuba.webContextName = app
----
+
<<cuba.webHostName,cuba.webHostName>>, <<cuba.webPort,cuba.webPort>> and <<cuba.webContextName,cuba.webContextName>> parameters are not mandatory for WebClient cluster, but they allow easier identification of a server in other platform mechanisms, such as the <<jmx_console, JMX console>>. Additionally, *Client Info* attribute of the *User Sessions* screen shows an identifier of the Web Client that the current user is working with.

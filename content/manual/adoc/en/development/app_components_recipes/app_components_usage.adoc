==== Using Public Add-ons

An add-on published on Marketplace can be added to your project in one of the ways described below. The first and the second approaches assume that you use one of the <<access_to_repo, standard CUBA repositories>>. The last approach is applicable for open-source add-ons and doesn't involve any remote repositories.

[[app_components_usage_by_studio]]
By Studio::
+
--
If you are using CUBA Studio 11+, manage add-ons via **CUBA Add-Ons** window as described in the {studio_man_url}/#add_ons[Studio documentation].

For the previous CUBA Studio versions, follow the steps below:

. Edit *Project properties* and on the *App components* panel click the plus button next to *Custom components*.

. Copy add-on coordinates from the marketplace page or from the add-on's documentation and paste them in the coordinates field, for example:
+
[source, plain]
----
com.haulmont.addon.cubajm:cuba-jm-global:0.3.1
----

. Click *OK* in the dialog. Studio will try to find the add-on binaries in the repository currently selected for the project. If it is found, the dialog will close and the add-on will appear in the list of custom components.

. Save the project properties by clicking *OK*.
--

[[app_components_usage_manual_edit]]
By manual editing::
+
--
. Edit `build.gradle` and specify the add-on coordinates in the root `dependencies` section:
+
[source, groovy]
----
dependencies {
    appComponent("com.haulmont.cuba:cuba-global:$cubaVersion")
    // your add-ons go here
    appComponent("com.haulmont.addon.cubajm:cuba-jm-global:0.3.1")
}
----

. Execute `gradlew idea` in the command line to include add-on in your project's development environment.

. Edit `web.xml` files of the `core` and `web` modules and add the add-on identifier (which is equal to Maven groupId) to the space-separated list of application components in the `appComponents` context parameter:
+
[source, xml]
----
<context-param>
    <param-name>appComponents</param-name>
    <param-value>com.haulmont.cuba com.haulmont.addon.cubajm</param-value>
</context-param>
----
--

[[app_components_usage_from_sources]]
By building from sources::
+
--
. Clone the add-on's repository to a local directory and import the project into Studio.

. Execute *CUBA > Advanced > Install app component* main menu command to install the add-on to the local Maven repository (by default it is `~/.m2` directory).

. Open your project in Studio and add the local Maven repository to the repositories list in *Project > Properties*.

. Install the add-on into the project using the *CUBA Add-ons* dialog in Studio. For details, see *Installing add-on by coordinates* in the {studio_man_url}/#add_ons[Managing Add-ons] section of the *Studio User Guide*.

. Click *OK* in the dialog and save the project properties.
--

[TIP]
====
If a project uses more than one add-ons having a **web-toolkit** module, then the project must have **web-toolkit** module too. If not, then only one widgetset from one add-on is loaded in the application. So the **web-toolkit** module is needed to integrate all widgetsets from used add-ons.

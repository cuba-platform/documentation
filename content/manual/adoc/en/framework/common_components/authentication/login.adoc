===== Login

CUBA Platform provides built-in extensible authentication mechanisms. They include different authentication schemes such as login/password, remember me, trusted and anonymous login.

This section primarily describes authentication mechanisms of the middle tier. For web client specifics, see <<web_login>>.

The platform includes the following authentication mechanisms on middleware:

- `AuthenticationManager` implemented by `AuthenticationManagerBean`
- `AuthenticationProvider` implementations
- `AuthenticationService` implemented by `AuthenticationServiceBean`
- `UserSessionLog` - see <<userSession_log,user session logging>>.

Also, it employs the following additional components:

- `TrustedClientService` implemented by `TrustedClientServiceBean` - provides anonymous/system sessions to trusted clients.
- `AnonymousSessionHolder` - creates and holds anonymous session instance for trusted clients.
- `UserCredentialsChecker` - checks if user credentials can be used, for instance, protect against brute-force attack.
- `UserAccessChecker` - checks if user can access system from the given context, for instance, from REST or using provided IP address.

The main interface for authentication is `AuthenticationManager` which contains four methods:

[source, java]
----
include::{sourcesdir}/common/authenticationManager.java[]
----

There are two methods with similar responsibility: `authenticate()` and `login()`. Both methods check if provided credentials are valid and corresponds to a valid user, then return `AuthenticationDetails` object. The main difference between them is that `login` method additionally activates user session, thus it can be used for calling service methods later.

`Credentials` represent a set of credentials for authentication subsystem. The platform has several types of credentials that are supported by `AuthenticationManager`:

Available for all tiers:

* `LoginPasswordCredentials`
* `RememberMeCredentials`
* `TrustedClientCredentials`

Available only on middle tier:

* `SystemUserCredentials`
* `AnonymousUserCredentials`

`AuthenticationManager` login / authenticate methods return `AuthenticationDetails` instance which contains <<userSession,UserSession>> object. This object can be used to check additional permissions, read *User* properties and session attributes. There is only one built-in implementation of `AuthenticationDetails` interface - *SimpleAuthenticationDetails* that stores only user session object, but application can provide its own `AuthenticationDetails` implementation with additional information for clients.

*AuthenticationManager* can do one of three things in its *authenticate()* method:

 - return `AuthenticationDetails` if it can verify that the input represents a valid user.
 - throw `LoginException` if it cannot authenticate user with the passed credentials object.
 - throw `UnsupportedCredentialsException` if it does not support the passed credentials object.

The default implementation of `AuthenticationManager` is `AuthenticationManagerBean`, which delegates authentication to a chain of `AuthenticationProvider` instances. An `AuthenticationProvider` is an authentication module that can process a specific `Credentials` implementation, also it has a special method `supports()` to allow the caller to query if it supports a given `Credentials` type.

.Standard user login process
image::LoginProcedure.png[align="center"]

Standard user login process:

* The user enters their username and password.

* Application client invokes `Connection.login()` method passing the user login and password.

* `Connection` creates `Credentials` object and invokes `login()` method of `AuthenticationService`.

* `AuthenticationService` delegates execution to the `AuthenticationManager` bean, which uses chain of `AuthenticationProvider` objects. There is `LoginPasswordAuthenticationProvider` that can work with `LoginPasswordCredentials` objects. It loads `User` object by the entered login, hashes the obtained password hash again using user identifier as salt and compares the obtained hash to the password hash stored in the DB. In case of mismatch, `LoginException` is thrown.

* If the authentication is successful, all the access parameters of the user (roles list, rights, restrictions and session attributes) are loaded to the created <<userSession,UserSession>> instance.

* If the <<userSession_log,user session logging>> is enabled, the record with the user session information is saved to the database.

See also <<web_login,Web Login Procedure>>.

Password hashing algorithm is implemented by the `EncryptionModule` type bean and is specified in <<cuba.passwordEncryptionModule,cuba.passwordEncryptionModule>> application property. SHA-1 is used by default.

[[built_in_authentication_providers]]
Built-in authentication providers::
+
--
The platform contains the following implementations of `AuthenticationProvider` interface:

- `LoginPasswordAuthenticationProvider`
- `RememberMeAuthenticationProvider`
- `TrustedClientAuthenticationProvider`
- `SystemAuthenticationProvider`
- `AnonymousAuthenticationProvider`

All the implementations load user from the database, verify the passed credentials object and create a non-active user session using `UserSessionManager`. That session instance can become active later in case of `AuthenticationManager.login()` is called.

`LoginPasswordAuthenticationProvider`, `RememberMeAuthenticationProvider` and `TrustedClientAuthenticationProvider` use additional pluggable checks: beans that implement `UserAccessChecker` interface. If at least one of the `UserAccessChecker` instances throw `LoginException` then authentication is considered failed and `LoginException` is thrown.

Besides, `LoginPasswordAuthenticationProvider` and `RememberMeAuthenticationProvider` check credentials instance using *UserCredentialsChecker* beans. There is only one built-in implementation of *UserCredentialsChecker* interface - *BruteForceUserCredentialsChecker* that checks if a user uses brute-force attack to find out valid credentials.
--

[[login_exceptions]]
Exceptions::
+
--
`AuthenticationManager` and `AuthenticationProvider` can throw *LoginException* or one of its descendants from `authenticate()` and `login()` methods. Also, *UnsupportedCredentialsException* is thrown if passed credentials object cannot be processed by available `AuthenticationProvider` beans.

See the following exception classes:

- `UnsupportedCredentialsException`
- `LoginException`
  - `AccountLockedException`
  - `UserIpRestrictedException`
  - `RestApiAccessDeniedException`

--

[[login_events]]
Events::
+
--
Standard implementation of `AuthenticationManager` - `AuthenticationManagerBean` fires the following application <<events, events>> during login / authentication procedure:

- `BeforeAuthenticationEvent` / `AfterAuthenticationEvent`
- `BeforeLoginEvent` / `AfterLoginEvent`
- `AuthenticationSuccessEvent` / `AuthenticationFailureEvent`
- `UserLoggedInEvent` / `UserLoggedOutEvent`
- `UserSubstitutedEvent`

Spring beans of the middle tier can handle these events using Spring `@EventListener` subscription:

[source, java]
----
include::{sourcesdir}/common/loginEventListener.java[]
----

Event handlers of all events mentioned above (excluding `AfterLoginEvent`, `UserSubstitutedEvent` and `UserLoggedInEvent`) can throw `LoginException` to interrupt authentication / login process.

For instance, we can implement maintenance mode valve for our application that will block login attempts if maintenance mode is active.

----
include::{sourcesdir}/common/maintenanceModeValve.java[]
----

[[login_extension_points]]
Extension points::
+
--
You can extend authentication mechanisms using the following types of extension points:

- `AuthenticationService` - replace existing `AuthenticationServiceBean`.
- `AuthenticationManager` - replace existing `AuthenticationManagerBean`.
- `AuthenticationProvider` implementations - implement additional or replace existing `AuthenticationProvider`.
- Events - implement event handler.

You can replace existing beans using Spring Framework mechanisms, for instance by registering a new bean in Spring XML config of the *core* module.

[source, xml]
----
<bean id="cuba_LoginPasswordAuthenticationProvider"
      class="com.company.authext.core.CustomLoginPasswordAuthenticationProvider"/>
----

[source, java]
----
include::{sourcesdir}/common/customAuthenticationProvider.java[]
----

Event handlers can be ordered using the `@Order` annotation. All the platform beans and event handlers use `order` value between 100 and 1000, thus you can add your custom handling before or after the platform code. If you want to add your bean or event handler before platform beans - use a value lower than 100.

Ordering for an event handler:
[source, java]
----
include::{sourcesdir}/common/eventListenerOrder.java[]
----

AuthenticationProviders can use *Ordered* interface and implement `getOrder()` method.

[[login_additional_eatures]]
Additional Features::
+
--
* The platform has a mechanism for the protection against password brute force cracking. The protection is enabled by the <<cuba.bruteForceProtection.enabled,cuba.bruteForceProtection.enabled>> application property on Middleware. If the protection is enabled then the combination of user login and IP address is blocked for a time interval in case of multiple unsuccessful login attempts. A maximum number of login attempts for the combination of user login and IP address is defined by the <<cuba.bruteForceProtection.maxLoginAttemptsNumber,cuba.bruteForceProtection.maxLoginAttemptsNumber>> application property (default value is 5). Blocking interval in seconds is defined by the <<cuba.bruteForceProtection.blockIntervalSec,cuba.bruteForceProtection.blockIntervalSec>> application property (default value is 60).

* It is possible that the user password (actually, password hash) is not stored in the database, but is verified by external means, for example, by means of integration with LDAP. In this case the authentication is in fact performed by the client block, while the Middleware "trusts" the client by creating the session based on user login only, without the password, using `AuthenticationService.login()` method with `TrustedClientCredentials`. This method requires satisfying the following conditions:

  - The client block has to pass the so-called trusted password, specified in the <<cuba.trustedClientPassword,cuba.trustedClientPassword>> Middleware and client block application property.

  - IP address of the client block has to be in the list specified in the <<cuba.trustedClientPermittedIpList,cuba.trustedClientPermittedIpList>> application property.

* Login to the system is also required for scheduled automatic processes as well as for connecting to the Middleware beans using JMX interface. Formally, these actions are considered administrative and they do not require authentication as long as no entities are changed in the database. When an entity is persisted to the database, the process requires login of the user who is making the change so that the login of the user responsible for the changes is stored.
+
An additional benefit from login to the system for an automatic process or for JMX call is that the server log output is displayed with the current user login if the user session is set to the execution thread. This simplifies searching messages created by specific process during log parsing.
+
System access for the processes within Middleware is done using `AuthenticationManager.login()` with `SystemUserCredentials` containing the login (without password) of the user on whose behalf the process will be executed. As result, <<userSession,UserSession>> object will be created and cached in the corresponding Middleware block but it will not be replicated in the cluster.

See more about processes authentication inside Middleware in <<system_authentication>>.

[[login_obsolete]]
Obsolete/Deprecated::
+
--

The following components now are considered deprecated:

- `LoginService` delegates login methods execution to `AuthenticationService`
- `LoginWorker` delegates login methods execution to `AuthenticationManager`

Do not use these components in your code. They will be removed in the next version of the platform.

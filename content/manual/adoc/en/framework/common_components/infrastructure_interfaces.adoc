==== Infrastructure Interfaces

Infrastructure interfaces provide access to frequently used functionality of the platform. Most of them are located in the *global* <<app_modules,module>> and can be used both on the middle and client tiers. However, some of them (<<persistence,Persistence>>, for example) are accessible only for Middleware code.

Infrastructure interfaces are implemented by Spring Framework beans, so they can be injected into any other managed components (<<managed_beans,managed beans>>, <<services,Middleware services>>, generic user interface <<screen_controller,screen controllers>>).

Also, like any other beans, infrastructure interfaces can be obtained using static methods of `AppBeans` class, and can be used in non-managed components (POJO, helper classes etc.).

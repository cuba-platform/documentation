The interface is used to obtain `UUID` values, including those used for entity identifiers. Using `UUID.randomUUID()` in the application code is not recommended.

To call from a static context, you can use the `UuidProvider` class, which also has an additional `fromString()` method that works faster than the standard `UUID.fromString()` method.

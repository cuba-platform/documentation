==== Messages Localization

Applications based on CUBA platform support messages localization, which means that all user interface elements can be displayed in the language, selected by user.

Language selection options are determined by the combination of <<cuba.localeSelectVisible,cuba.localeSelectVisible>> and <<cuba.availableLocales,cuba.availableLocales>> application properties.

This section describes the localization mechanism and rules of localized messages creation. For information about obtaining messages see <<getting_messages>>.

===== Using the Bean

A reference to the bean can be obtained through injection or through the `AppBeans` class. As an example of using the bean, let us look at the implementation of the `OrderService` bean that delegates the execution to the `OrderWorker` bean:

[source, java]
----
include::{sourcesdir}/common/managedbean_5.java[]
----

In this example, the service starts a <<transactions,transaction>>, merges the detached entity obtained from the client level into the <<entityManager,persistent context>>, and passes the control to the `OrderWorker` bean, which contains the main business logic.

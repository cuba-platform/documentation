===== Search Folders

Search folders can be created by the users similar to application folders. Group folders are created directly via the context menu of the folder panel. The folders connected to screens are created from the *Filter...* button menu, using the Save as search folder option.

Creating global search folders, requires the user to have *Create/edit global search folders* permission (`cuba.gui.searchFolder.global`).

Search folder's filter can be edited once the folder is created by opening the folder and changing the *Folder:{folder name}* filter. Saving the filter will change the folder filter as well.

Search folders are instances of the `SearchFolder` entity stored in the related *SYS_FOLDER* and *SEC_SEARCH_FOLDER* tables.

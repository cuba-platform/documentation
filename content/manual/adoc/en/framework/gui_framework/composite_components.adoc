A composite component is a component consisting of other components. Like screen fragments, composite components allow you to reuse some presentation layout and logic. We recommend using composite components in the following cases:

* The component functionality can be implemented as a combination of existing Generic UI components. If you need some non-standard features, create a <<own_components, custom component>> by wrapping a Vaadin component or JavaScript library, or use <<jsComponent>>.
* The component is relatively simple and does not load or save data itself. Otherwise, consider creating a <<using_screen_fragments,screen fragment>>.

The class of a composite component must extend the `CompositeComponent` base class. A composite component must have a single component at the root of the inner components tree. The root component can be obtained using the `CompositeComponent.getComposition()` method.

Inner components are usually created declaratively in an XML descriptor. In this case, the component class should have the `@CompositeDescriptor` annotation which specifies the path to the descriptor file. If the annotation value does not start with `/`, the file is loaded from the component's class package.

Alternatively, the inner components tree can be created programmatically in a `CreateEvent` listener.

`CreateEvent` is sent by the framework when it finishes the initialization of the component. At this moment, if an XML descriptor is used by the component, it is loaded, and `getComposition()` method returns the root component. This event can be used for any additional initialization of the component or for creating the inner components without XML.

Below we demonstrate the creation of Stepper component which is designed to edit integer values in the input field and by clicking on up/down buttons located next to the field.

Let's assume the project has `com/company/demo` base package.

[[composite_components_xml]]
Component layout descriptor::
+
--
Create an XML descriptor with the component layout in the `com/company/demo/web/components/stepper/stepper-component.xml` file of the `web` module:

[source, xml]
----
include::{sourcesdir}/gui/composite/composite_xml.xml[]
----

<1> - XSD defines the content of the component descriptor
<2> - a single root component
<3> - any number of nested components
--

[[composite_components_class]]
Component implementation class::
+
--
Create the component implementation class in the same package:

[source, java]
----
include::{sourcesdir}/gui/composite/composite_class.java[]
----

<1> - the `@CompositeDescriptor` annotation specifies the path to the component layout descriptor which is located in the class package.
<2> - the component class extends `CompositeComponent` parameterized by the type of the root component.
<3> - our component implements the `Field<Integer>` interface because it is designed to display and edit an integer value.
<4> - a set of interfaces with default methods to implement standard Generic UI component functionality.
<5> - name of the component which is used to register the component in `ui-component.xml` file to be recognized by the framework.
<6> - fields containing references to inner components.
<7> - component's property which defines the value of a single click to up/down buttons. It has public getter/setter methods and can be assigned in screen XML.
<8> - component initialization is done in the `CreateEvent` listener.
--

[[composite_components_loader]]
Component loader::
+
--
Create the component loader which is needed to initialize the component when it is used in screen XML descriptors:

[source, java]
----
include::{sourcesdir}/gui/composite/composite_loader.java[]
----

<1> - loader class must extend `AbstractComponentLoader` parameterized by the class of the component. As our component implements `Field`, use more specific `AbstractFieldLoader` base class.
<2> - create the component by its name.
<3> - load the `step` property value from XML if it is specified.
--

[[composite_components_registration]]
Registration of the component::
+
--
In order to register the component and its loader with the framework, create the `com/company/demo/ui-component.xml` file of the `web` module:

[source, xml]
----
include::{sourcesdir}/gui/composite/composite_registration.xml[]
----

Add the following property to `com/company/demo/web-app.properties`:

[source, properties]
----
cuba.web.componentsConfig = +com/company/demo/ui-component.xml
----

Now the framework will recognize the new component in XML descriptors of application screens.
--

[[composite_components_xsd]]
Component XSD::
+
--
XSD is required to use the component in screen XML descriptors. Define it in the `com/company/demo/ui-component.xsd` file of the `web` module:

[source, xml]
----
include::{sourcesdir}/gui/composite/composite_xsd.xsd[]
----

<1> - inherit all base field properties.
<2> - define an attribute for the `step` property.
--

[[composite_components_usage]]
Usage of the component::
+
The following example shows how the component can be used in a screen:

--
[source, xml]
----
include::{sourcesdir}/gui/composite/composite_usage.xml[]
----

<1> - the namespace referencing the component's XSD.
<2> - the composite component connected to the `limit` attribute of an entity.
--

[[composite_components_style]]
Custom styling::
+
--
Now let's apply some custom styles to improve the component look.

First, change the root component to <<gui_CssLayout,CssLayout>> and assign style names to the inner components. Besides custom styles defined in the project (see below), the following predefined styles are used: {sampler_url}/open?screen=styles-containers[v-component-group], {sampler_url}/open?screen=styles-button[icon-only].

[source, xml]
----
include::{sourcesdir}/gui/composite/composite_xml_cssLayout.xml[]
----

Change the component class accordingly:

[source, java]
----
include::{sourcesdir}/gui/composite/composite_class_cssLayout.java[]
----

Generate theme extension (see {studio_man_url}/#generic_ui_themes[here] how to do it in Studio) and add the following code to the `modules/web/themes/hover/com.company.demo/hover-ext.scss` file:

[source, css]
----
include::{sourcesdir}/gui/composite/composite_class_css.css[]
----

Restart the application server and open the screen. The form with our composite Stepper component should look as follows:

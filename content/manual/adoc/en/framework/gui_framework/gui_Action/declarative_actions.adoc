[[declarative_actions]]
===== Declarative Actions

You can specify a set of <<gui_Action,actions>> in an XML screen descriptor for any component that implements the `Component.ActionsHolder` interface, including the entire window or fragment. This is done in the `actions` element, which contains nested `action` elements.

The `action` element can have the following attributes:

* `id` − identifier, which should be unique within the `ActionsHolder` component.

* `type` - defines a specific action type. If this attribute is set, the framework finds the class having `@ActionType` annotation with the specified value, and uses it to instantiate the action. If the type is not defined, the framework creates an instance of <<baseAction,BaseAction>> class. See <<standard_actions>> for how to use action types provided by the framework and <<custom_action_types>> for how to create your own types.

* `caption` – action name.

* `description` – action description.

* `enable` – accessibility flag (`true` / `false`).

* `icon` – action icon.

[[actions_primary]]
* `primary` - attribute that indicates if a button representing this action should be highlighted with a special visual style (`true` / `false`).
+
--
The highlighting is available by default in the `hover` theme; to enable this feature in the `halo` theme, set `true` for the `$cuba-highlight-primary-action` <<web_theme_extension_common,style variable>>.

The `create` standard list action and the `lookupSelectAction` in the lookup screen are primary by default.

* `shortcut` - a keyboard shortcut.
+
--
Shortcut values can be hard-coded in the XML descriptor. Possible modifiers, `ALT`, `CTRL`, `SHIFT`, are separated by the "-" character. For example:

[source, xml]
----
<action id="create" shortcut="ALT-N"/>
----

To avoid the hard-coded values, you can use the predefined shortcut aliases from the list below, for example:

[source, xml]
----
<action id="edit" shortcut="${TABLE_EDIT_SHORTCUT}"/>
----

** `TABLE_EDIT_SHORTCUT`

** `COMMIT_SHORTCUT`

** `CLOSE_SHORTCUT`

** `FILTER_APPLY_SHORTCUT`

** `FILTER_SELECT_SHORTCUT`

** `NEXT_TAB_SHORTCUT`

** `PREVIOUS_TAB_SHORTCUT`

** `PICKER_LOOKUP_SHORTCUT`

** `PICKER_OPEN_SHORTCUT`

** `PICKER_CLEAR_SHORTCUT`

Another option is to use the fully qualified name of the `Config` interface and method which returns shortcut:

[source, xml]
----
<action id="remove" shortcut="${com.haulmont.cuba.client.ClientConfig#getTableRemoveShortcut}"/>
----
--

* `visible` – visibility flag (`true` / `false`).

The examples of action declaration and handling are provided below.

* Declaring actions for the whole screen:
+
[source, xml]
----
include::{sourcesdir}/gui/actions_1.xml[]
----
+
[source, java]
----
include::{sourcesdir}/gui/actions_2.java[]
----
+
In the example above, an action with `sayHello` identifier and a caption from the screen's <<message_packs,message pack>> is declared. This action is bound to a button, which caption will be set to the action's name. The screen controller subscribes to the action's `ActionPerformedEvent`, so the `onSayHelloActionPerformed()` method will be invoked when the user clicks the button or presses the ALT-T keyboard shortcut.

[WARNING]
====
Note that actions declared for the whole screen do not refresh their state. It means that if an action has specific `enabledRule`, it will not be applied until `refreshState()` is invoked manually.
====

* Declaring actions for <<gui_PopupButton,PopupButton>>: 
+
[source, xml]
----
include::{sourcesdir}/gui/actions_3.xml[]
---- 
+
[source, java]
----
include::{sourcesdir}/gui/actions_3_1.java[]
----

* Declaring actions for <<gui_Table,Table>>: 
+
[source, xml]
----
include::{sourcesdir}/gui/actions_4.xml[]
----
+
[source, java]
----
include::{sourcesdir}/gui/actions_4_1.java[]
----
+
In this example, the `copy` action is declared in addition to `create`, `edit` and `remove` standard actions of the table. The `trackSelection="true"` attribute means that the action and corresponding button become disabled if no row is selected in the table. It is useful if the action is intended to be executed for a currently selected table row.

* Declaring <<gui_PickerField,PickerField>> actions: 
+
[source, xml]
----
include::{sourcesdir}/gui/actions_5.xml[]
----
+
[source, java]
----
include::{sourcesdir}/gui/actions_5_1.java[]
----
+
In the example above, the standard `picker_lookup` action and an additional `show` action are declared for the `PickerField` component. Since `PickerField` buttons that display actions use icons instead of captions, the caption attribute is not set. The `description` attribute allows you to display a tooltip when hovering over the action button.

You can obtain a reference to any declared action in the screen controller either directly by injection, or from a component that implements the `Component.ActionsHolder` interface. It can be useful to set action properties programmatically. For example:

[source, java]
----
include::{sourcesdir}/gui/actions_6.java[]

The `Filter` is a versatile tool for filtering lists of entities extracted from a database to display in a tabular form. The component enables quick data filtering by arbitrary conditions, as well as creating filters for repeated use.

`Filter` should be connected to a <<gui_collection_container,CollectionContainer>> with a <<gui_data_loaders,loader>> or a <<datasources,CollectionDatasource>> containing a JPQL <<datasource_query,query>>. Its logic is based on the modification of the query in accordance with the criteria provided by the user. Thus, filtering is done at the database level when the SQL query is executed, and only selected data is loaded to the Middleware and Client <<app_tiers,tiers>>.

[[gui_Filter_use]]
*Using a Filter*

A typical filter is shown below:

image::gui_filter_descr.png[align="center"]

By default, the component is in quick filter mode. This means that a user can add a set of conditions for a one-off data search. After the screen is closed, the conditions will disappear.

To create a quick filter, click *Add search condition* link. The condition selection screen will be displayed:

image::gui_filter_conditions.png[align="center"]

Possible condition types are described below:

* *Attributes* – attributes of this entity and related entities. Only persistent attributes are displayed. They should also either be explicitly set in the `property` element of the filter XML descriptor, or comply with the rules specified in the <<gui_Filter_properties,properties>> element.

* *Custom conditions* – conditions specified by developer in the `custom` elements of the filter XML descriptor.

* *Create new...* – enables creating a new arbitrary JPQL condition. This option is only available to users having the specific `cuba.gui.filter.customConditions` <<permissions,permission>>.

Selected conditions are displayed at the top of the filter panel. The image:gui_filter_remove_condition.png[] icon will appear next to each condition field, allowing them to be removed from the set.

Quick filters can be saved for further re-use. In order to save a quick filter, click the filter settings icon, select *Save/Save as* and provide a new filter name in the popup dialog:

image::gui_filter_name.png[align="center"]

After that, the filter will be saved and will appear in the drop-down menu of the *Search* button.

The *Reset filter* menu lets you reset all currently applied search conditions.

image::gui_filter_reset.png[align="center"]

The filter settings popup button provides the list of options for filter management:

* *Save* – save changes to the current filter.

* *Save with values* – save changes to the current filter using the values in parameter editors as filter default values.

* *Save as* – save the filter under a new name.

* *Edit* – open the filter editor (see below).

* *Make default* – make the filter default for this screen. The filter will be automatically displayed on the filter panel when the screen is opened.

* *Remove* – delete the current filter.

* *Pin applied* – use the results of the last search for sequential data filtering (see <<gui_Filter_sequential_apply, Applying Filters Sequentially>>).

* *Save as search folder* – create a <<search_folder,search folder>> based on the current filter.

* *Save as application folder* – create an <<application_folder,application folder>> based on the current filter. This option is available to users having the specific `cuba.gui.appFolder.global` permission only.

The *Edit* option opens the filter editor, allowing advanced configuration of the current filter:

image::gui_filter_editor.png[align="center"]

Filter name should be provided in the *Name* field. This name will be displayed in available filters list for the current screen.

Filter can be made _global_ (i.e., available to all users) using the *Available to all users* checkbox and _global default_ using the *Global default* checkbox. These operations require a specific <<permissions, permission>> called CUBA > Filter > Create/modify global filters. If the filter is marked as _global default_ then it will be automatically selected when users open the screen. Users can set their own default filters using the *Default for me* checkbox. This setting overrides the _global default_ one.

The filter conditions are contained in the tree. They can be added using the *Add* button, swapped using image:gui_filter_cond_down.png[]/image:gui_filter_cond_up.png[] or removed using the *Remove* button.

AND or OR grouping conditions can be added with the help of the corresponding buttons. All top level conditions (i.e., without explicit grouping) are joined with AND.

Selecting a condition in the tree opens the list of its properties in the right part of the editor.

The conditions can be made hidden or required by means of corresponding checkboxes. The hidden condition parameter is invisible to the user, so it should be provided when the filter is being edited.

*Width* property enables selecting the width of the parameter field on the filter panel for the current condition. By default, conditions on the filter panel are displayed in three columns. The field width equals to the number of columns it will occupy (1, 2 or 3).

Default parameter value for the current condition can be selected in the *Default value* field.

A custom caption for filter condition can be provided in the *Caption* field.

*Operation* field enables selecting the condition operator. The list of available operators depends on the attribute type.

If an entity has an attribute of the `DateTime` type with no <<ignoreUserTimeZone,@IgnoreUserTimeZone>> annotation, the the user's <<timeZone, time zone>> will be respected in filters for this attribute by default. As for the `Date` type, you can define whether the user's time zone should be respected by using the special *Use time zone* flag in the custom condition editor.

[[gui_Filter_component]]
*Filter Component*

XML name of the component: `filter`.

An example of component declaration in XML screen descriptor is shown below:

[source, xml]
----
include::{sourcesdir}/gui_vcl/filter_1.xml[]
---- 

In the example above, a <<gui_data_containers,data container>> is defined in the `data` layer of the screen. The container selects `Car` entity instances using JPQL query. The <<gui_data_loaders,data loader>> which provides data to be filtered is specified in the `filter` component's `loader` attribute. Data is displayed using the <<gui_Table,Table>> component, which is connected to the same data container.

`filter` may contain nested elements. They describe conditions available for user selection in *Add Condition* dialog:

[[gui_Filter_properties]]
* `properties` – multiple entity attributes can be made available for selection. This element has the following attributes:
+
--
[[gui_Filter_properties_include]]
** `include` – required attribute. It contains a regular expression, which should match an entity attribute name.

[[gui_Filter_properties_exclude]]
** `exclude` – contains a regular expression. If an attribute matches the expression, it will be excluded from previously included (using `include`).

[[gui_Filter_properties_excludeProperties]]
** `excludeProperties` – contains a comma-separated list of property paths that should be excluded from filtering. As opposed to `exclude`, it supports traversing the entity graphs, for example: `customer.name`.

[[gui_Filter_properties_excludeRecursively]]
** `excludeRecursively` - defines if an attribute from `excludeProperties` should be excluded recursively for the whole object graph. If `true`, an attribute and all its nested attributes with the same name will be excluded.
+
For example:
+
[source, xml]
----
include::{sourcesdir}/gui_vcl/filter_2.xml[]
----
+
To exclude properties programmatically, use the `setPropertiesFilterPredicate()` method of the `Filter` component:
+
[source, java]
----
include::{sourcesdir}/gui_vcl/filter_7.java[]
----

The following entity attributes are ignored when `properties` element is used:

** Not accessible due to security <<permissions,permissions>>.

** Collections (`@OneToMany`, `@ManyToMany`).

** Non-persistent attributes.

** Attributes that do not have <<entity_localization,localized names>>.

** Attributes annotated with `@SystemLevel`.

** Attributes of type `byte[]`.

** The `version` attribute.
--

[[gui_Filter_property]]
* `property` – explicitly includes an entity attribute by name. This element has the following attributes:
+
--
[[gui_Filter_property_name]]
** `name` – required attribute, containing the name of entity attribute to be included. It can be a path (using ".") in the entity graph. For example:
+
[source, xml]
----
include::{sourcesdir}/gui_vcl/filter_3.xml[]
---- 

[[gui_Filter_property_caption]]
** `caption` – localized entity attribute name displayed in filter conditions. Generally it is a string with the `msg://` prefix in accordance with <<messageTools.loadString,MessageTools.loadString()>> rules.
+
If the `name` attribute is specified as an entity graph path (using ".") , the `caption` attribute is required.

[[gui_Filter_property_paramWhere]]
** `paramWhere` − specifies the JPQL expression which is used to select the list of condition parameter values if the parameter is a related entity. The `{E}` placeholder should be used in the expression instead of the alias of the entity being selected.
+
For example, let us assume that `Car` has a reference to `Model`. Then possible condition parameter values list can be limited to `*Audi*` models only:
+
[source, xml]
----
include::{sourcesdir}/gui_vcl/filter_4.xml[]
---- 
+
Screen parameters, session attributes and screen components including those showing other parameters can be used in JPQL expression. Query parameters specification rules are described in <<gui_data_comp_dep>> and <<datasource_query>>.
+
An example of session and screen parameters usage is shown below: 
+
[source, jpql]
----
{E}.createdBy = :session$userLogin and {E}.name like :param$groupName
---- 
With the `paramWhere` clause, you can introduce dependencies between parameters. For example, let us assume that `Manufacturer` is a separate entity. That is `Car` has a reference to `Model` which in turn has a reference to `Manufacturer`. Then you may want to create two conditions for the Cars filter: first to select a Manufacturer and second to select a Model. To restrict the list of models by previously selected manufacturer, add a parameter to the `paramWhere` expression:
+
[source, jpql]
----
{E}.manufacturer.id = :component$filter.model_manufacturer90062
---- 
+
The parameter references a component which displays Manufacturer parameter. You can see the name of the component showing condition parameter by opening context menu on a condition table row in the filter editor:
+
[[gui_Filter_parameter_component_name]]
image::gui_filter_component_name.png[align="center"]

[[gui_Filter_property_paramView]]
** `paramView` − specifies a <<views,view>>, which will be used to load the list of condition parameter values if the parameter is a related entity. For example, `++_local++`. If view is not specified, `++_minimal++` view will be used.
--

[[gui_Filter_custom]]
* `custom` is an element defining an arbitrary condition. The element content should be a JPQL expression (<<jpql_macro,JPQL Macros>> can be used), which will be added to the data container query's `where` clause. The `{E}` placeholder should be used in the expression instead of the alias of the entity being selected. The condition can only have one parameter denoted by "?" if used.
+
--
A value of custom condition can contain special characters, for example "%" or "_" for "like" operator. If you want to escape these characters, add `escape '<char>'` to your condition, for example:

[source, sql]
----
{E}.name like ? escape '\'
----

Then if you use `foo\%` as a value of the condition parameter, the search will interpret "%" as a character in your name and not as a special character.

An example of a filter with arbitrary conditions is shown below: 

[source, xml]
----
include::{sourcesdir}/gui_vcl/filter_5.xml[]
---- 

`custom` conditions are displayed in the *Custom conditions* section of the *Add condition* dialog:

image::gui_filter_custom.png[align="center"]

Attributes of `custom`:

[[gui_Filter_custom_name]]
** `name` − required attribute, condition name.

[[gui_Filter_custom_caption]]
** `caption` − required attribute, localized condition name. Generally it is a string with the `msg://` prefix in accordance with <<messageTools.loadString,MessageTools.loadString()>> rules.

[[gui_Filter_custom_paramClass]]
** `paramClass` − Java class of the condition parameter. If the parameter is not specified, this attribute is optional.

[[gui_Filter_custom_inExpr]]
** `inExpr` − should be set to `true`, if the JPQL expression contains `in (?)` conditions. In this case user will be able to enter several condition parameter values.

[[gui_Filter_custom_join]]
** `join` − optional attribute. It specifies a string, which will be added to the data container query `from` section. This can be required to create a complex condition based on an attribute of a related collection. `join` or `left join` statements should be included into the attribute value.
+
For example, let us assume that the `Car` entity has a `repairs` attribute, which is a related entity `Repair` instances collection. Then the following condition can be created to filter `Car` by `Repair` entity's `description` attribute: 
+
[source, xml]
----
include::{sourcesdir}/gui_vcl/filter_6.xml[]
---- 
+
If the condition above is used, the original data container query
+
[source, jpql]
----
select c from sample_Car c order by c.createTs
----
+
will be transformed into the following one:
+
[source, jpql]
----
select c from sample_Car c join c.repairs cr
where (cr.description like ?)
order by c.createTs
----

** `paramWhere` − specifies a JPQL expression used to select the list of condition parameter values if the parameter is a related entity. See the description of the `property` element's <<gui_Filter_property_paramWhere,attribute>> of the same name.

** `paramView` − specifies a <<views,view>>, which will be used when a list of condition parameter values are loaded if the parameter is a related entity. See the description of the `property` element's <<gui_Filter_property_paramView,attribute>> of the same name.
--

`filter` attributes:

[[gui_Filter_editable]]
* `editable` – if the attribute value is `false`, the *Edit* option is disabled.

[[gui_Filter_manualApplyRequired]]
* `manualApplyRequired` − defines when the filter will be applied. If the attribute value is `false`, the filter (default or empty) will be applied when the screen is opened. It means that the data container will be refreshed and linked components (e.g. `Table`) will display data. If the value is `true`, the filter will be applied only after the *Search* button is clicked.
+
This attribute takes precedence over the <<cuba.gui.genericFilterManualApplyRequired,cuba.gui.genericFilterManualApplyRequired>> application property.

[[gui_Filter_useMaxResults]]
*  `useMaxResults` − limits the page size of entity instances loaded into the data container. It is set to `true` by default.
+
If the attribute value is `false`, the filter will not show the *Show rows* field. The number of records in the data container (and displayed in the table accordingly) will be limited only by the `MaxFetchUI` parameter of the <<entity_statistics,entity statistics>>, which is set to 10000 by default.
+
If the attribute is not specified or is `true`, the *Show rows* field will be displayed only if the user has specific `cuba.gui.filter.maxResults` <<permissions,permission>>. If the `cuba.gui.filter.maxResults` permission is not granted, the filter will force selecting only the first N rows without user to be able to disable it or specify another N. N is defined by `FetchUI`, `DefaultFetchUI` parameters. They are obtained from the <<entity_statistics,entity statistics>> mechanism.
+
A filter shown below has the following parameters: `useMaxResults="true"`, the `cuba.gui.filter.maxResults` permission is denied, and `cuba.gui.filter.maxResults` `DefaultFetchUI = 2.`

image::gui_filter_useMaxRezult.png[align="center"]

[[gui_Filter_textMaxResults]]
* `textMaxResults` - enables using the text field instead of the drop-down list as the *Show rows* field. `false` by default.

[[gui_Filter_folderActionsEnabled]]
* `folderActionsEnabled` − if it is set to `false`, the following filter actions will be hidden: *Save as Search Folder*, *Save as Application Folder*. By default, the attribute value is `true`, and *Save as Search Folder*, *Save as Application Folder* are available.

[[gui_Filter_applyTo]]
* `applyTo` − optional attribute, contains the identifier of a component associated with the filter. It is used when access to related component <<gui_Table_presentations,presentations>> is required. For example, when saving the filter as a <<search_folder,search folder>> or as an <<application_folder,application folder>>, the presentation that will be applied when browsing this folder can be specified.
+
image::gui_filter_apply_to.png[align="center"]

[[gui_Filter_caption]]
* `caption` - enables setting a custom caption for the filter panel.

[[gui_Filter_columnsCount]]
* `columnsCount` - defines the number of columns for conditions on the filter panel. Default value is 3.

[[gui_Filter_defaultMode]]
* `defaultMode` - defines the filter default mode. Possible values are `generic` and `fts`. When `fts` value is set then the filter will be opened in the full text search mode (if the entity is indexed). The default value is `generic`.

[[gui_Filter_modeSwitchVisible]]
* `modeSwitchVisible` - defines the visibility of the checkbox that switches the filter to the full text search mode. If full text search is unavailable then the checkbox will be invisible despite of the defined value. Possible values are `true` and `false` (`true` by default).

*Methods of Filter interface:*

* `setBorderVisible()` - defines if the filter border should be displayed. The default value is `true`.

*Listeners of Filter:*
[[gui_Filter_ExpandedStateChangeListener]]
* `ExpandedStateChangeListener` - enables tracking the expanded state changes.

[[gui_Filter_FilterEntityChangeListener]]
* `FilterEntityChangeListener` - is triggered when a filter is selected for the first time on a component initialization or later from the list of saved filters.

The appearance of the `Filter` component can be customized using SCSS variables with `$cuba-filter-*` prefix. You can change these variables in the visual editor after creating a <<web_theme_extension,theme extension>> or a <<web_theme_creation,custom theme>>.

[[gui_Filter_permissions]]
*User Permissions*

* To create/change/delete global (available to all users) filters, user must have the `cuba.gui.filter.global` <<permissions,permission>>.

* To create/change `custom` conditions user must have a `cuba.gui.filter.customConditions` permission.

* To change the maximum number of rows per table page using the *Show rows* field, user must have the `cuba.gui.filter.maxResults` permission. See also the <<gui_Filter_useMaxResults,useMaxResults>> filter attribute.

For specific permissions configuration information, see <<security_subsystem>>.

[[gui_Filter_ext_params]]
*External Filter Control Parameters*

[[gui_Filter_app_properties]]
* *System-wide parameters*
+
--
The following application properties affect filter behavior:

* <<cuba.gui.genericFilterManualApplyRequired,cuba.gui.genericFilterManualApplyRequired>> − disables automatic applying of the filter (i.e., data loading) when the screen is opened. See also <<gui_Filter_manualApplyRequired,manualApplyRequired>> filter attribute.

* <<cuba.gui.genericFilterChecking,cuba.gui.genericFilterChecking>> − enables the check that at least one condition is filled before applying the filter.

* <<cuba.gui.genericFilterControlsLayout,cuba.gui.genericFilterControlsLayout>> − defines an internal layout of the filter controls.

* <<cuba.allowQueryFromSelected,cuba.allowQueryFromSelected>> enables switching off <<gui_Filter_sequential_apply,sequential filters application>> mechanism.

* <<cuba.gui.genericFilterColumnsCount,cuba.gui.genericFilterColumnsCount>> - sets the default number of columns for placing conditions on the filter panel. See also <<gui_Filter_columnsCount,columnsCount>> filter attribute.

* <<cuba.gui.genericFilterConditionsLocation,cuba.gui.genericFilterConditionsLocation>> - defines the location of the conditions panel.

* <<cuba.gui.genericFilterPopupListSize,cuba.gui.genericFilterPopupListSize>> - defines the maximum number of items displayed in the popup list of the *Search* button.

* <<cuba.gui.genericFilterTrimParamValues,cuba.gui.genericFilterTrimParamValues>> - defines whether all generic text filters should trim input values.
--

[[gui_Filter_screen_parameters]]
* *Screen invocation parameters*
+
--
It is possible to specify a filter and its parameters which should be applied when the screen is opened. For this purpose, the filter should be created in advance, stored in the database, and a corresponding record in the `SEC_FILTER` table should have a value in the `CODE` field. Screen invocation parameters are set in the `web-menu.xml` configuration file.

In order to store the filter in the database, the insert script for the filter should be added to the `30.create-db.sql` script of the entity. To simplify the script creation, find the filter in the *Entity Inspector* section of the *Administration* menu, in the filter's context menu choose *System Information*, click *Script for insert* button and copy the script.

Then you can adjust the screen to use the filter by default. To specify a filter code, pass to the screen a parameter with the same name as filter component identifier in this screen. Parameter value should be the code of the filter.

To set filter parameter values, pass to the screen parameters with the names equal to parameter names and their values in string format.

An example of main menu item descriptor is shown below. It sets a filter with the `FilterByVIN` code to the `carsFilter` component of the `sample$Car.browse` screen which it opens. It also sets `TMA` value to the `component$carsFilter.vin79216` condition:

[source, xml]
----
include::{sourcesdir}/gui_vcl/filter_ext_param_1.xml[]
----

It should be noted that a filter with a defined `CODE` field has some specifics:

* It cannot be edited by users.

* Name of this filter can be displayed in several languages. To achieve this, specify a string with key equal to the filter code in the application <<main_message_pack,main message pack>>.
--

[[gui_Filter_sequential_apply]]
*Applying Filters Sequentially*

If the <<cuba.allowQueryFromSelected,cuba.allowQueryFromSelected>> application property is enabled, the last applied filter and the current filtered results can be pinned via the component's user interface. After that another filter or other parameters of the current filter can be selected and applied to the currently selected records.

This approach helps to achieve two aims:

* Decompose complex filters, which may lead to better performance as well.

* Apply filters to the records selected using <<application_folder,application>> or <<search_folder,search>> folders.

Take the following steps to use sequential filters. First, choose and apply one of the filters. Next click the filter settings button and select *Pin applied*. The filter will be pinned at the top of the filter panel. Then another filter can be applied to the selected records and so on. Any number of filters can be applied sequentially. Filters can also be removed using image:gui_filter_remove.png[] button.

image::gui_filter_sequential.png[align="center"]

The sequential filters implementation is based on the ability of <<dataManager,DataManager>> to run <<query_from_selected,sequential queries>>.

[[gui_Filter_params_api]]
*API for Working with Filter Parameters*

The `Filter` interface provides methods for reading and writing of filter parameter values in a screen controller:

* `setParamValue(String paramName, Object value)`
* `getParamValue(String paramName)`

`paramName` - filter parameter name. Parameter name is a part of component name that displays a parameter value. The procedure of getting a component name was described <<gui_Filter_parameter_component_name,above>>. Parameter name is placed after the last dot in a component name. For example, if the component name is `component$filter.model_manufacturer90062`, then the parameter name is `model_manufacturer90062`.

Note that you cannot use these methods in the <<screen_InitEvent,InitEvent>> handler of the screen controller, because the filter is not initialized at that moment. A good place to work with filter parameters is the <<screen_BeforeShowEvent,BeforeShowEvent>> handler.

[[gui_Filter_fts]]
*Full-Text Search Mode in Filter*

If a filter data container contains entities that are indexed by the full-text search subsystem (see link:{fts_man_url}[CUBA Platform. Full Text Search]), then a full-text search mode is available in the filter. Use the *Full-Text Search* checkbox to switch to this mode.

image::gui_filter_fts.png[align="center"]

In the full-text search mode, the filter contains text fields for search criteria, and the search is performed in entity fields indexed by the FTS subsystem.

If a table is defined in the <<gui_Filter_applyTo,applyTo>> attribute, then placing the mouse cursor on the table row will display a tooltip with the information what entity attributes satisfy the search criteria.

For hiding the filter mode checkbox, set `false` value to the <<gui_Filter_modeSwitchVisible,modeSwitchVisible>> filter attribute.

If you want the filter to be opened in the full-text search mode by default, set `fts` value to the <<gui_Filter_defaultMode,defaultMode>> filter attribute.

Full-text search can be used combined with any number of filter conditions:

image::book_publication_fts_filter.png[align="center"]

The *FTS condition* can be selected in the conditions selection window.

====== Creating a GWT component

In this section, we will cover the creation of a simple GWT component (a rating field consisting of 5 stars) and its usage in application screens.

Create a new project in CUBA Studio and name it `ratingsample`.

Create the *web-toolkit* module. A convenient way to do this is to use *CUBA Studio*: in the main menu, click *CUBA > Advanced > Manage modules > Create 'web-toolkit' Module*.

In order to create a GTW component, we need to create the following files:

* `RatingFieldWidget.java` - a GWT widget in the *web-toolkit* module.

* `RatingFieldServerComponent.java` - a Vaadin component class.

* `RatingFieldState.java` - a component state class.

* `RatingFieldConnector.java` - a connector that links the client code with the server component.

* `RatingFieldServerRpc.java` - a class that defines a server API for the client.

Let's create required files and make necessary changes in them.

* Create the `RatingFieldWidget` class in the *web-toolkit* module. Replace its content with the following code:
+
[source, java]
----
include::{sourcesdir}/ui_component/gwt/RatingFieldWidget.java[]
----
+
A widget is a client-side class responsible for displaying the component in the web browser and handling events. It defines interfaces for working with the server side. In our case these are the `setValue()` method and the `StarClickListener` interface.

* `RatingFieldServerComponent` is a Vaadin component class. It defines an API for the server code, accessor methods, event listeners and data sources connection. Developers use the methods of this class in the application code.
+
[source, java]
----
include::{sourcesdir}/ui_component/gwt/RatingFieldServerComponent.java[]
----

* The `RatingFieldState` state class defines what data are sent between the client and the server. It contains public fields that are automatically serialized on server side and deserialized on the client.
+
[source, java]
----
include::{sourcesdir}/ui_component/gwt/RatingFieldState.java[]
----

* The `RatingFieldServerRpc` interface defines a server API that is used from the client-side. Its methods may be invoked by the RPC mechanism built into Vaadin. We will implement this interface in the component.
+
[source, java]
----
include::{sourcesdir}/ui_component/gwt/RatingFieldServerRpc.java[]
----

* Create the `RatingFieldConnector` class in the *web-toolkit* module. Connector links client code with the server.
+
[source, java]
----
include::{sourcesdir}/ui_component/gwt/RatingFieldConnector.java[]
----

The `RatingFieldWidget` class does not define the component appearance, it only assigns style names to key elements. To define an appearance of the component, we'll create stylesheet files. A convenient way to do this is to use *CUBA Studio*: in the main menu, click *CUBA > Advanced > Manage themes > Create theme extension*. Select the `hover` theme in the popup window. Another way is to use the `extend-theme` command in https://www.cuba-platform.com/marketplace/cuba-cli[CUBA CLI]. The `hover` theme uses *FontAwesome* font glyphs instead of <<icon_set,icons>>. We'll use this fact.

It is recommended to put component styles into a separate file `componentname.scss` in the `components/componentname` directory in the form of SCSS mixture. Create the `components/ratingfield` directories structure in the `themes/hover/com.company.ratingsample` directory of the *web* module. Then create the `ratingfield.scss` file inside the `ratingfield` directory:

[source, css]
----
include::{sourcesdir}/ui_component/gwt/ratingfield.scss[]
----

Include this file in the `hover-ext.scss` main theme file:

[source, css]
----
include::{sourcesdir}/ui_component/gwt/hover-ext.scss[]
----

To demonstrate how the component works let's create a new screen in the *web* module.

Name the screen `rating-screen`.

Open the `rating-screen.xml` file in the IDE. We need a container for our component. Declare it in the screen XML:

[source, xml]
----
include::{sourcesdir}/ui_component/gwt/rating-screen.xml[]
----

Open the `RatingScreen.java` screen controller and add the code that puts the component to the screen.

[source, java]
----
include::{sourcesdir}/ui_component/gwt/RatingScreen.java[]
----

Start the application server and see the result.

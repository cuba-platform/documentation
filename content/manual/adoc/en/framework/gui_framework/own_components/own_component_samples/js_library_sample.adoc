====== Using a JavaScript library

In this example, we will use the https://jqueryui.com/slider/#range[Slider] component from the *jQuery UI* library. The slider will have two drag handlers that define a values range.

Create a new project in CUBA Studio and name it `jscomponent`.

In order to use the Stepper component, we need to create the following files:

* `SliderServerComponent` - a Vaadin component integrated with JavaScript.

* `SliderState` - a state class of the Vaadin component.

* `slider-connector.js` - a JavaScript connector for the Vaadin component.

The process of integration into the Generic UI is the same as described at <<vaadin_addon_sample_gui>>, so we won't repeat it here.

Let's create required files in the `toolkit/ui/slider` subfolder of the *web* module add make necessary changes.

* `SlideState` state class defines what data is transferred between the server and the client. In our case it is a minimal possible value, maximum possible value and selected values.
+
[source, java]
----
include::{sourcesdir}/ui_component/js/SliderState.java[]
----

* Vaadin server-side component `SliderServerComponent`.
+
[source, java]
----
include::{sourcesdir}/ui_component/js/SliderServerComponent.java[]
----
+
The server component defines getters and setters to work with the slider state and an interface of value change listeners. The class extends `AbstractJavaScriptComponent`.
+
The `addFunction()` method invocation in the class constructor defines a handler for an RPC-call of the `valueChanged()` function from the client.
+
The `@JavaScript` and `@WebJarResource` annotations point to files that must be loaded on the web page. In our example, these are JavaScript files of the jquery-ui library and the stylesheet for jquery-ui located in the <<using_webjars,WebJar resource>>, and the connector that is located in the Java package of the Vaadin server component.

* JavaScript connector `slider-connector.js`.
+
[source, javascript]
----
include::{sourcesdir}/ui_component/js/slider-connector.js[]
----
+
Connector is a function that initializes a JavaScript component when the web page is loaded. The function name must correspond to the server component class name where dots in package name are replaced with underscore characters.
+
Vaadin adds several useful methods to the connector function. `this.getElement()` returns an HTML DOM element of the component, `this.getState()` returns a state object.
+
Our connector does the following:
+
--
* Initializes the `slider` component of the jQuery UI library. The `slide()` function is invoked when the position of any drag handler changes. This function in turn invokes the `valueChanged()` connector method. `valuedChanged()` is the method that we defined on the server side in the `SliderServerComponent` class.

* Defines the `onStateChange()` function. It is called when the state object is changed on the server side.
--

To demonstrate how the component works, let's create the `Product` entity with three attributes:

* `name` of type String
* `minDiscount` of type Double
* `maxDiscount` of type Double

Generate standard screens for the entity. Ensure that the *Module* field is set to `Module: 'app-web_main'` (this field is shown only if the *gui* module is added to the project).

The `slider` component will set minimal and maximum discount values of a product.

Open the `product-edit.xml` file. Make `minDiscount` and `maxDiscount` fields not editable by adding the `editable="false"` attribute to the corresponding elements. Then add a box that will be used as a container for a Vaadin component.

As a result, the XML descriptor of the editor screen should look as follows:

[source, xml]
----
include::{sourcesdir}/ui_component/js/product-edit.xml[]
----

Open the `ProductEit.java` file. Replace its content with the following code:

[source, java]
----
include::{sourcesdir}/ui_component/js/ProductEdit.java[]
----

The `onInitEntity()` method sets initial values for discounts of a new product.

Method `onBeforeShow()` initializes the `slider` custom field. It sets current, minimal and maximum values of the `slider` and defines the value change listener. When the drag handler moves, a new value will be set to the corresponding field of the editable entity.

Start the application server and open the product editor screen. Changing the drop handler position must change the value of the text fields.

====== Integrating a Vaadin Component into the Generic UI

In the <<vaadin_addon_sample,previous section>>, we have included the third-party Stepper component in the project. In this section, we will integrate it into CUBA Generic UI. This will allow developers to use the component declaratively in the screen XML and bind it to the data model entities through <<gui_data,Data Components>>.

In order to integrate Stepper into CUBA Generic UI, we need to create the following files:

* `Stepper` - an interface of the component in the *gui* subfolder of the *web* module.

* `WebStepper` - a component implementation in the *gui* subfolder of the *web* module.

* `StepperLoader` - a component XML-loader in the *gui* subfolder of the *web* module.

* `ui-component.xsd` - a new component XML schema definition. If the file already exists, add the information about the new component to the existing file.

* `cuba-ui-component.xml` - the file that registers a new component loader in *web* module. If the file already exists add the information about the new component to the existing file.

Open the project in the IDE.

Let's create required files add make necessary changes.

* Create the `Stepper` interface in the *gui* subfolder of the *web* module. Replace its content with the following code:
+
[source, java]
----
include::{sourcesdir}/ui_component/vaadin_gui/Stepper.java[]
----
+
The base interface for the component is `Field`, which is designed to display and edit an entity attribute.

* Create the `WebStepper` class - a component implementation in the *gui* subfolder of the *web* module. Replace its content with the following code:
+
[source, java]
----
include::{sourcesdir}/ui_component/vaadin_gui/WebStepper.java[]
----
+
The chosen base class is `WebV8AbstractField`, which implements the methods of the `Field` interface.

* The `StepperLoader` class in the *gui* subfolder of the *web* module loads the component from its representation in XML.
+
[source, java]
----
include::{sourcesdir}/ui_component/vaadin_gui/StepperLoader.java[]
----
+
The `AbstractFieldLoader` class contains code for loading basic properties of the `Field` component. So `StepperLoader` loads only the specific properties of the `Stepper` component.

* The `cuba-ui-component.xml` file in the *web* module registers the new component and its loader. Replace its content with the following code:
+
[source, xml]
----
include::{sourcesdir}/ui_component/vaadin_gui/cuba-ui-component.xml[]
----

* The `ui-component.xsd` file in *web* module contains XML schema definitions of custom visual components. Add the `stepper` element and its attributes definition.
+
[source, xml]
----
include::{sourcesdir}/ui_component/vaadin_gui/ui-component.xsd[]
----

Let's see how to add the new component to a screen.

* Either remove the changes made in the <<vaadin_addon_sample,previous section>> or generate editor screen for the entity.

* Add the `stepper` component to the editor screen. You can add it either declaratively or programmatically. We'll examine both methods.

. Using the component declaratively in an XML descriptor.
+
--
* Open the `customer-edit.xml` file.

* Define the new namespace `xmlns:app="http://schemas.company.com/agd/0.1/ui-component.xsd"`.

* Remove the `score` field from `form`.

* Add `stepper` component to the screen.

As a result, the XML descriptor should look like this:

[source, xml]
----
include::{sourcesdir}/ui_component/vaadin_gui/customer-edit-gui-declarative.xml[]
----

In the example above, the `stepper` component is associated with the `score` attribute of the `Customer` entity. An instance of this entity is managed by the `customerDc` instance container.
--

. Programmatic creation of the component in a Java controller.
+
[source, xml]
----
include::{sourcesdir}/ui_component/vaadin_gui/customer-edit-gui-programmatic.xml[]
----
+
[source, java]
----
include::{sourcesdir}/ui_component/vaadin_gui/CustomerEditGuiProgrammatic.java[]
----

* Start the application server. The resulting editor screen will look as follows:

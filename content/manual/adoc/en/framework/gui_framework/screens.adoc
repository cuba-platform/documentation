==== Screens

A generic UI screen is defined by an <<screen_xml,XML-descriptor>> and a <<screen_controller,controller>> class. The descriptor has a link to the controller class.

In order to be able to invoke the screen from the main menu or from Java code (e.g. from controller of a different screen) the XML-descriptor should be registered in the project's <<screens.xml,screens.xml>> file. The default screen that should be opened after login can be set using the <<cuba.web.defaultScreenId,cuba.web.defaultScreenId>> <<app_properties,application property>>.

The main menu of an application is generated separately for the Web Client and the Desktop Client based on the <<menu.xml,menu.xml>> files, located in the project's *web* and *desktop* modules.

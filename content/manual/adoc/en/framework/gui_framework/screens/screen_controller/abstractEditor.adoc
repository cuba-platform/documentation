[[abstractEditor]]
====== AbstractEditor

`AbstractEditor` is the base class for <<screen_edit,edit screen>> controller. It is a subclass of <<abstractWindow,AbstractWindow>>.

When creating a controller class, it is recommended to parameterize `AbstractEditor` with the edited entity class. This enables `getItem()` and `initNewItem()` methods work with the specified entity type and application code does not need to do additional type conversion. For example:

[source, java]
----
include::{sourcesdir}/gui/abstracteditor_1.java[]
---- 

`AbstractEditor` defines the following own methods:

[[abstractEditor_getItem]]
* `getItem()` – returns an instance of the entity being edited, which is set in the main <<datasources,datasource>> of the screen (i.e. specified in the `datasource` attribute of the root element of the XML-descriptor).
+
If the instance being edited is not a new one, screen opening procedure will reload the instance from the database with the required <<views,view>> as set for the main datasource.
+
Changes made to the instance returned by `getItem()`, are reflected in the state of the datasource and will be sent to the Middleware at commit.
+
[WARNING]
====
It should be considered that `getItem()` returns a value only after screen is initialized with `setItem()` method. Until this moment, this method returns `null`, for instance when calling from inside `init()` or `initNewItem()`.

However, in the `init()` method, an instance of an entity passed to `openEditor()` can be retrieved from parameters using the following approach: 

[source, java]
----
include::{sourcesdir}/gui/abstracteditor_2.java[]
---- 

The `initNewItem()` method receives an instance as a parameter of the appropriate type.

In both cases the obtained entity instance will be reloaded afterwards unless it is a new one. Therefore you should not change it or save it in a field for future use.
====

[[abstractEditor_setItem]]
* `setItem()` – invoked by the framework when a window is opened using `openEditor()` to set the instance being edited to the main datasource. By the moment of invocation all screen components and datasources will have been created and the controller's `init()` method will have been executed.
+
It is recommended to use template methods `initNewItem()` and `postInit()`, instead of overriding `setItem()` in order to initialize a screen. 

[[initNewItem]]
* `initNewItem()` – a template method invoked by the framework before setting the edited entity instance into the main datasource.
+
The `initNewItem()` method is called for newly created entity instances only. The method is not called for <<entity_states,detached>> instances. This method can be implemented in the controller, if new entity instances must be initialized before setting them in the datasource. For example:
+
[source, java]
----
include::{sourcesdir}/gui/abstracteditor_3.java[]
---- 
+
A more complex example of using the `initNewItem()` method can be found in the <<init_values_in_initNewItem,cookbook>>.

[[abstractEditor_postInit]]
* `postInit()` – a template method invoked by the framework immediately after the edited entity instance is set to the main datasource. In this method, `getItem()` can be called to return a new entity instance or an instance re-loaded during screen initialization.
+
This method can be implemented in controller for final screen initialization, for example: 
+
[source, java]
----
include::{sourcesdir}/gui/abstracteditor_4.java[]
---- 

[[abstractEditor_commit]]
* `commit()` – validates the screen and submits changes to the Middleware via <<dataSupplier,DataSupplier>>.
+
If a method is used with `validate = false`, commit does not perform a validation.
+
It is recommended to use specialized template methods – `postValidate()`, `preCommit()` and `postCommit()` instead of overriding this method.

[[abstractEditor_commitAndClose]]
* `commitAndClose()` – validates the screen, submits changes to the Middleware and closes the screen. The value of the `++Window.COMMIT_ACTION_ID++` will be passed to the `preClose()` method and registered `CloseListener` listeners. 
+
It is recommended to use specialized template methods – `postValidate()`, `preCommit()` and `postCommit()` instead of overriding this method.

[[abstractEditor_preCommit]]
* `preCommit()` – a template method invoked by the framework during the commit process, after a successful validation, but before the data is submitted to the Middleware.
+
This method can be implemented in controller. If the method returns `false`, commit process gets interrupted, as well as window closing process (if `commitAndClose()` was invoked). For example: 
+
[source, java]
----
include::{sourcesdir}/gui/abstracteditor_5.java[]
---- 

[[abstractEditor_postCommit]]
* `postCommit()` – a template method invoked by the framework at the final stage of committing changes. Method parameters are:

** `committed` – set to `true`, if the screen had changes and they have been submitted to Middleware.

** `close` – set to `true`, if the screen should be closed after the changes are committed.
+
If the screen does not close the default implementation of this method displays a message about successful commit and invokes `postInit()`.
+
This method can be overridden in controller in order to perform additional actions after successful commit, for example: 
+

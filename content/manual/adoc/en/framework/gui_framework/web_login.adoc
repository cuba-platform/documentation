==== Web Login

This section describes how the web client authentication works and how to extend it in your project. For information about authentication on the middle tier, see <<login>>.

Implementation of the login procedure of the Web Client block has the following mechanisms:

- `Connection` implemented by `ConnectionImpl`.
- `LoginProvider` implementations.
- `HttpRequestFilter` implementations.

.Login mechanisms of the Web Client
image::WebLoginStructure.png[align="center"]

The main interface of Web login subsystem is `Connection` which contains the following key methods:

- *login()* - authenticates a user, starts a session and changes the state of the connection.
- *logout()* - log out of the system.
- *substituteUser()* - substitute a user in the current session with another user. This method creates a new *UserSession* instance, but with the same session ID.
- *getSession()* - get the current user session.

After successful login, *Connection* sets *UserSession* object to the attribute of `VaadinSession` and sets `SecurityContext`. The *Connection* object is bound to `VaadinSession` thus it cannot be used from non-UI threads, it throws *IllegalConcurrentAccessException* in case of `login/logout` call from a non UI thread.

Usually, login is performed from the `LoginScreen` screen that supports login with login/password and "remember me" credentials.

The default implementation of `Connection` is `ConnectionImpl`, which delegates login to a chain of `LoginProvider` instances. A `LoginProvider` is a login module that can process a specific `Credentials` implementation, also it has a special `supports()` method to allow the caller to query if it supports a given `Credentials` type.

.Standard user login process
image::WebLoginProcedure.png[align="center"]

Standard user login process:

* Users enter their username and password.

* Web client block creates a `LoginPasswordCredentials` object passing the login and password to its constructor and invokes `Connection.login()` method with this credentials.

* `Connection` uses chain of `LoginProvider` objects. There is `LoginPasswordLoginProvider` that works with `LoginPasswordCredentials` instances. Depending on the <<cuba.checkPasswordOnClient,cuba.checkPasswordOnClient>> it either invokes `AuthenticationService.login(Credentials)` passing user's login and password; or loads the `User` entity by login, checks the password against the loaded password hash and logs in as a trusted client with `TrustedClientCredentials` and <<cuba.trustedClientPassword,cuba.trustedClientPassword>>.

* If the authentication is successful, the created `AuthenticationDetails` instance with the active <<userSession,UserSession>> is passed back to `Connection`.

* `Connection` creates a `ClientUserSession` wrapper and sets it to `VaadinSession`.

* `Connection` creates a `SecurityContext` instance and sets it to `AppContext`.

* `Connection` fires `StateChangeEvent` that triggers UI update and leads to the `MainScreen` initialization.

All `LoginProvider` implementations must:

* Authenticate user using `Credentials` object.
* Start a new user session with `AuthenticationService` or return another active session (for instance, anonymous).
* Return authentication details or null if it cannot login user with this `Credentials` object, for instance, if the login provider is disabled or is not properly configured.
* Throw `LoginException` in case of incorrect `Credentials` or pass `LoginException` from the middleware to the caller.

[[web_http_filter]]
`HttpRequestFilter` - marker interface for beans that will be automatically added to the application filter chain as HTTP filter: https://docs.oracle.com/javaee/6/api/javax/servlet/Filter.html. You can use it to implement additional authentication, pre- and post-processing of request and response.

You can expose additional `Filter` if you create Spring Framework component and implement `HttpRequestFilter` interface:
[source, java]
----
include::{sourcesdir}/gui/web_customHttpFilter.java[]
----

Please note that the minimal implementation has to delegate execution to `FilterChain` otherwise your application will not work. By default, filters added as `HttpRequestFilter` beans will not receive requests to `VAADIN` directory and other paths specified in `cuba.web.cubaHttpFilterBypassUrls` app property.

[[built_in_login_providers]]
Built-in login providers::
+
--
The platform contains the following implementations of `LoginProvider` interface:

- `AnonymousLoginProvider` - provides anonymous login for non-logged-in users.
- `LoginPasswordLoginProvider` - delegates login to `AuthenticationService` with `LoginPasswordCredentials`.
- `RememberMeLoginProvider`- delegates login to `AuthenticationService` with `RememberMeCredentials`.
- `LdapLoginProvider` - accepts `LoginPasswordCredentials`, performs authentication using LDAP and delegates login to `AuthenticationService` with `TrustedClientCredentials`.
- `ExternalUserLoginProvider` - accepts `ExternalUserCredentials` and delegates login to `AuthenticationService` with `TrustedClientCredentials`. It can be used to perform login as a provided user name.

All the implementations create an active user session using `AuthenticationService.login()`.

You can override any of them using Spring Framework mechanisms.

[[web_login_events]]
Events::
+
--
Standard implementation of `Connection` - `ConnectionImpl` fires the following application <<events, events>> during login procedure:

- `BeforeLoginEvent` / `AfterLoginEvent`
- `LoginFailureEvent`
- `UserConnectedEvent` / `UserDisconnectedEvent`
- `UserSessionStartedEvent` / `UserSessionFinishedEvent`
- `UserSessionSubstitutedEvent`

Event handlers of `BeforeLoginEvent` and `LoginFailureEvent` may throw `LoginException` to cancel login process or override the original login failure exception.

For instance, you can permit login to Web Client only for users with login that includes a company domain using `BeforeLoginEvent`.

[source, java]
----
include::{sourcesdir}/gui/web_beforeLoginEventListener.java[]
----

Additionally, the standard application class - `DefaultApp` fires the following events:

- `AppInitializedEvent` - fired after `App` initialization, performed once per HTTP session.
- `AppStartedEvent` - fired on the first request processing of an `App` right before login as anonymous user. Event handlers may login the user using the `Connection` object bound to `App`.
- `AppLoggedInEvent` - fired after UI initialization of `App` when a user is logged in.
- `AppLoggedOutEvent` - fired after UI initialization of `App` when a user is logged out.
- `SessionHeartbeatEvent` - fired on heartbeat requests from a client web browser.

`AppStartedEvent` can be used to implement SSO login with third-party authentication system, for instance Jasig CAS. Usually, it is used together with a custom `HttpRequestFilter` bean that should collect and provide additional authentication data.

Let's assume that we will automatically log in users if they have a special cookie value - `PROMO_USER`.

[source, java]
----
include::{sourcesdir}/gui/web_appStartedEventListener.java[]
----

Thus if users have "PROMO_USER" cookie and open the application, they will be automatically logged in as `promoUserLogin`.

If you want to perform additional actions after login and UI initialization you could use `AppLoggedInEvent`. Keep in mind that you have to check if a user is authenticated or not in event handlers, all the events are fired for `anonymous` user as well.

[[web_session_events]]
Web Session Lifecycle Events::
+
--
Depending on web session state two events can be published:

- `WebSessionInitializedEvent` - fired when HTTP session is initialized.
- `WebSessionDestroyedEvent` - fired when HTTP session is destroyed.

These events can be used to perform some system-level actions. Note that there is no `SecurityContext` available in the thread.
--

[[web_login_extension_points]]
Extension points::
+
--
You can extend login mechanisms using the following types of extension points:

- `Connection` - replace existing `ConnectionImpl`.
- `HttpRequestFilter` - implement additional `HttpRequestFilter`.
- `LoginProvider` implementations - implement additional or replace existing `LoginProvider`.
- Events - implement event handler for one of the available <<web_login_events,events>>.

You can replace existing beans using Spring Framework mechanisms, for instance by registering a new bean in Spring XML config of the *web* module.

[[dataSupplier]]
===== DataSupplier

`DataSupplier` – interface, through which the datasources refer to Middleware for loading and saving entities. The standard implementation simply delegates to <<dataManager,DataManager>>. A screen can define its implementation of the `DataSupplier` in `dataSupplier` attribute of the `window` element.

A reference to `DataSupplier` can be obtained either by injection into a screen controller or through the `DsContext` or `Datasource` instances. In both cases, an own implementation is returned if defined for the screen.

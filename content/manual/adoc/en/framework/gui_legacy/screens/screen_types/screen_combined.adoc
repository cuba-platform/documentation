[[screen_combined]]
====== Combined Screen

The combined screen allows you to display a list of entities on the left and an edit form for a selected entity on the right. So it is a combination of <<screen_lookup,lookup>> and <<screen_edit,edit>> screens.

The controller of a combined screen should be inherited from the <<entityCombinedScreen,EntityCombinedScreen>> class.

[TIP]
====
You can create a combined screen for an entity in Studio using the *Entity combined screen* template.

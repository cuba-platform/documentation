[[orm]]
==== ORM Layer

Object-Relational Mapping is the technology for linking relational database tables to programming language objects. 

Benefits of using ORM::: 

* Enables working with a relational DBMS by means of Java objects manipulation.
* Simplifies programming by eliminating routine writing of SQL queries.
* Simplifies programming by letting you load and save entire object graphs with one command.
* Ensures easy porting of the application to different DBMS.
* Enables use of a concise object query language – <<jpql, JPQL>>.

Shortcomings:::

* Requires understanding of how ORM works.
* Makes direct optimization of SQL and use of the DBMS specifics difficult.

CUBA uses the ORM implementation based on the *EclipseLink* framework.

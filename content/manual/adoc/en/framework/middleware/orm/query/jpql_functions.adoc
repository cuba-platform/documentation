====== JPQL Functions

The main difference in JPQL between CUBA and standard JPA is that CUBA functions always require an alias, both in `SELECT` and `UPDATE/DELETE` statements.

|===
|CUBA |JPA
m|UPDATE app$DeliveryAddress **e** SET **e**.customer = :target WHERE **e**.customer = :source
m|UPDATE app$DeliveryAddress SET customer = :target WHERE customer = :source
|===

The JPQL `DELETE FROM` statement throws an exception if launched for the soft-deleted entity and the <<soft_deletion,Soft Delete>> mode is on. Such statement is actually transformed to SQL which deletes all instances not marked for deletion. The soft deletion is disabled by default and can be enabled using the <<cuba.enableDeleteStatementInSoftDeleteMode,cuba.enableDeleteStatementInSoftDeleteMode>> application property.

The table below describes the JPQL functions supported and not supported by CUBA Platform.

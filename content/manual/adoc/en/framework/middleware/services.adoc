==== Services

Services form the layer that defines a set of Middleware operations available to the client <<app_tiers,tier>>. In other words, a service is an entry point to the Middleware business logic. In a service, you can manage <<transactions,transactions>>, check user <<permissions,permissions>>, work with the database or delegate execution to other <<managed_beans,managed beans>> of the middle tier.

Below is a class diagram which shows the components of a service:

The service interface is located in the *global* module and is available for both middle and client tiers. At runtime, a proxy is created for the service interface on the client tier. The proxy provides invocation of service bean methods using Spring HTTP Invoker mechanism.

The service implementation bean is located in the *core* module and is available on the middle tier only.

`ServiceInterceptor` is called automatically for any service method using Spring AOP. It checks the availability of the user session for the current thread, and transforms and logs exceptions if the service is called from the client tier.

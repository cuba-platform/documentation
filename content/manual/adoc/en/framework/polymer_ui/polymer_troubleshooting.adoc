==== Troubleshooting
Proxy::
If you work behind a proxy you may need to configure bower and npm accordingly. In order to allow bower and npm to work behind a proxy create the following files in the `modules/polymer-client/`
directory:

 .bowerrc
[source,json]
----
{
    "proxy":"http://<user>:<password>@<host>:<port>",
    "https-proxy":"http://<user>:<password>@<host>:<port>"
}
----

 .npmrc
[source]
----
proxy=http://<user>:<password>@<host>:<port>
https-proxy=http://<user>:<password>@<host>:<port>
----

NPM install failed::
There is a https://github.com/npm/npm/issues/19934[known issue] with `npm install` command on Windows.

You may experience the following error in the build process:
----
npm ERR! code EPERM
npm ERR! errno -4048
npm ERR! syscall rename
npm ERR! Error: EPERM: operation not permitted,
----

As a workaround, you can try to disable Windows Defender/any other antivirus software, make sure you do not open project in any IDE and run build again.

Track the following https://youtrack.cuba-platform.com/issue/STUDIO-4504[issue] for upcoming possible solution.

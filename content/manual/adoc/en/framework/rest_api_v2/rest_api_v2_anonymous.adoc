==== Anonymous Access

By default, anonymous access is disabled. To enable it, use the <<cuba.rest.anonymousEnabled, cuba.rest.anonymousEnabled>> application property. A request is considered to be anonymous if it doesn't contain an `Authentication` header. In this case, the <<securityContext, SecurityContext>> will contain an anonymous user session.

To set up permissions for anonymous user you must define <<roles, roles>> for the user specified by the <<cuba.anonymousLogin, cuba.anonymousLogin>> application property.

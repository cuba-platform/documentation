[[rest_api_v2_persistent_token_store]]
==== Persistent Token Store

By default, OAuth tokens are stored in memory only. If you want to persist them in the database as well, you should set the <<cuba.rest.storeTokensInDb,cuba.rest.storeTokensInDb>> application property to `true`. The property value is stored in the database, so you can change its value in the *Administration > Application Properties* screen.

Expired tokens in the database store must be periodically deleted. The cron expression for scheduled removing of expired tokens is specified in the <<cuba.rest.deleteExpiredTokensCron,cuba.rest.deleteExpiredTokensCron>> application property.

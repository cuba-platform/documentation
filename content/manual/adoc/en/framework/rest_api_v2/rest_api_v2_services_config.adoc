[[rest_api_v2_services_config]]
==== Services Configuration

The list of service methods that are available via the REST API must be configured in the CUBA application in files registered in the <<cuba.rest.servicesConfig, cuba.rest.servicesConfig>> application property of the *web* or *portal* module (e.g in the `web-app.properties file`):

[source,properties]
----
cuba.rest.servicesConfig = +com/company/myapp/rest-services.xml
----

The content of the `rest-services.xml` must be placed in the root package of the *web* or *portal* module (e.g. `com.company.myapp`). Its content is defined by the http://schemas.haulmont.com/cuba/{revnumber}/rest-services-v2.xsd[rest-services-v2.xsd] schema, for example:

[source, xml]
----
include::{sourcesdir}/rest/rest-services-config.xml[]
----

Method parameter types can be omitted if the service doesn't contain an overloaded method with the same number of parameters. Otherwise, types must be defined.

An example of how to configure and invoke a service can be found in the <<rest_api_v2_ex_service_get>> chapter.

[[quick_start]]
== Quick Start

This section describes the process of creating an application using *CUBA Studio*. Similar information is provided in the videos available at link:$$https://www.cuba-platform.com/quickstart$$[www.cuba-platform.com/quickstart].

Make sure that the necessary software is already installed and set up on your computer, see <<setup>>.

Key stages of our application development: 

. Data model development including creation of <<data_model,entities>> describing application domain and corresponding database tables.

. Development of the user interface screens enabling to create, view, update and delete data model entities.

[[qs_app_details]]
=== Application Details

The application should maintain information about the customers and their orders. 

A customer has the following attributes:

* Name
* E-mail

Order attributes:

* Ownership by a customer
* Date
* Amount

The application UI should contain: 

* Customers browser screen;
* Customer editor screen, containing as well the list of this customer's orders;
* General orders browser screen;
* Order editor screen.

The application should support user interface in English and Russian. 

[[qs_create_project]]
=== Creating a Project

. Start CUBA Studio and open its web interface (See <<cubaStudio_install>>).

. Click *Create new*.

. Specify the name of the new project in the *Project name* field of the *New project* window – for example, `sales`. The name should contain only Latin letters, numbers and underscores. Think carefully on the project name at this stage, as changing it later on will require complex manual intervention.

. The following fields below will be automatically populated: 
+
* *Project path* – the path to the new project directory. You can select the directory manually by clicking the *...* button next to the field. The *Select folder* window will appear with the list of folders n your hard drive. You can select one of those, or create a new directory by clicking the *+* button.

* *Project namespace* – the namespace which will be used as a prefix for entity names and database tables. The namespace can consist of Latin letters only and should be as short as possible. For example, if the project name is `++sales_2++`, the namespace can be `sales` or `sal`.

* *Root package* − the root package of Java classes. It can be adjusted later, but the classes generated at project creation will not be moved.

* *Platform version* – the platform version used in the project. The platform artifacts will be automatically downloaded from the repository on project build.

. Click *OK*. Empty project will be created in the specified `sales` directory and the main Studio window will open.

. Assemble the project: select option *Build* > *Assemble project* in the Studio main menu. At this stage all required libraries will be downloaded and project <<artifact,artifacts>> will be assembled in `build` subdirectories of the modules.

. Create the database on the local *HyperSQL* server: select option *Run* > *Create database* in the menu. The database name is the same as project namespace by default.

. Select *Run* > *Deploy* menu option. *Tomcat* server with the deployed application will be installed in the project `build` subdirectory.

. Select *Run* > *Start application server* option. The link next to the *Web application* caption in the status panel will become available in a few seconds so you will be able to open the application directly from Studio.
+
The username and password are `admin` / `admin`.
+
The running application contains two main menu items (*Administration* and *Help*), as well as security and administration subsystems functionality.

[[qs_create_entities]]
=== Creating Entities

Let us create the `Customer` entity class.

* Go to the *Entities* tab in the navigation section and click *New entity*. The *New entity* dialog window will appear.

* Enter the name of the entity class – `Customer` – in the *Class name* field.
+
image::qs_create_customer_entity.png[align="center"]

* Click *OK*. The entity designer page will be displayed in the workspace.
+

image::qs_customer_entity.png[align="center"]

* The entity name and the database table name will be automatically generated in the *Name* and the *Table* fields respectively.

* Leave the existing value – `StandardEntity` - in the *Parent class* field.

* Leave the *Inheritance strategy* field blank. 

* Click image:localization.png[] button next to the *Name* to open the *Localized message* window. Specify <<localization,localization>> for the entity name for the available languages in it.

Next, let us create entity attributes. To do this, click the *New* button below the *Attributes* table.

* *Create attribute* window will appear. Enter the name of the entity attribute − `name`, in the *Name* field. Select `DATATYPE` value in the *Attribute type* list, specify `String` attribute type in the *Type* field and then set the length of the text attribute to 100 characters in the *Length* field. Check the *Mandatory* box. The name of the database table column will be automatically generated in the *Column* field.
+
image::qs_new_attribute.png[align="center"]
+
Now click image:localization.png[] button next to the attribute name to open the *Localized message* window. Localize the attribute name in the available languages.
+
Click *Add* to add the attribute.

* `email` attribute is created in the same way but the value in *Length* field should be set to `50`.

After creating the attributes, go to the *Instance name* tab in the entity designer to specify <<namePattern,Name pattern>>. Select the *name* attribute in the *Available attributes* list and move it to the *Name pattern attributes* list by clicking the button with the right arrow on it.

image::qs_customer_instance_name.png[align="center"]

Customer entity creation is now complete. Click *OK* in the top panel to save the changes and close the page.

Let us create the `Order` entity. Click *New entity* option on the *Entities* tab. Enter the *Class name* − `Order`. The entity should have the following attributes:

* *Name* − `customer`, *Attribute type* − `ASSOCIATION`, *Type* − `Customer`, *Cardinality* − `++MANY_TO_ONE++`.

* *Name* − `date`, *Attribute type* − `DATATYPE`, *Type* − `Date`. Check *Mandatory* box for `date` attribute.

* *Name* − `amount`, *Attribute type* − `DATATYPE`, *Type* − `BigDecimal`.

Specify localized caption for each of the attributes by clicking the image:localization.png[] button next to the attribute name.

[[qs_create_db_tables]]
=== Creating Database Tables

It is sufficient to click *Generate DB scripts* button in *Entities* tab on the navigation panel to <<db_update_in_dev,create database tables>>. After that, *Database scripts* page will open. Both incremental DB update scripts from the current state (*Update scripts*) and initial DB creation scripts (*Init tables*, *Init constraints*, *Init data*) will be generated on this page.

image::qs_generate_db_scripts.png[align="center"]

Click *Save and close* button to save the generated scripts. To run update scripts, stop the running application using the *Run* > *Stop application server* command, then select *Run* > *Update database*.

[[qs_create_ui]]
=== Creating User Interface Screens

Now we will create screens for customers and orders data management. 

[[qs_create_customer_screens]]
==== Screens for Customer

Select `Customer` entity in the *Entities* tab on the navigation panel to create standard screens for viewing and editing Customers. Click *Create standard screens* link at the bottom of the section. After that, *Create standard screens* page will appear.

image::qs_create_customer_screens.png[align="center"]

All fields in this dialog are already populated with default values, there is no need to change them. Click the *Create* button.

`customer-edit.xml` and `customer-browse.xml` items will appear in *GUI Module* on *Screens* tab of the navigation panel.

You can specify localized captions for the screens. For this, select a screen and click *Edit* to open the screen designer page. Go to the *Properties* tab. Click the image:localization.png[][] button next to the *Caption* field and specify screen names in different locales. Alternatively, you can open `messages.properties` item located in the screens package and edit `browseCaption` and `editCaption` messages for available locales.

[[qs_create_order_screens]]
==== Order Screens

`Order` entity has the following distinction: since one of the attributes is the `Order.customer` reference attribute, you should define a <<views,view>> including this attribute (standard `++_local++` view does not include reference attributes).

Go to the *Entities* tab on the navigation panel, select the `Order` entity and click the *New view* button. View designer page will open. Enter `orderWithCustomer` as the view name, click on `customer` attribute and select `++_minimal++` view for the `Customer` entity in the panel on the right.

image::qs_order_view.png[align="center"]

Click *OK* in the top panel.

After that, select the `Order` entity and click *Create standard screens*. Select `orderWithCustomer` in the *View* fields in both browser and editor panels of the *Create standard screens* page and click *Create*.

image::qs_create_order_screens.png[align="center"]

`order-edit.xml` and `order-browse.xml` items will appear in the *GUI Module* on the *Screens* tab of the navigation panel.

You can specify localized captions for the Order screens as described above for the Customer screens.

[[qs_create_menu]]
==== Application Menu

At the moment of their creation, the screens were added to the *application* menu item of the default application menu. Let us rename it. Switch to the *Main menu* tab on the navigation panel and click *Edit*. The *Menu designer* page will open. Select the `application` menu item to edit its properties.

Enter the new value of the menu identifier − `shop` − in the *Id* field, then click the *Caption* *edit* button and set localized names of the menu item.

image::qs_application_menu.png[align="center"]

After editing the menu, click *OK* in the top panel.

[[qs_customer_edit_with_orders]]
==== Customer Editor With a List of Orders

Do the following to display the list of Orders in the Customers edit screen:

* Go to the *Screens* tab on the navigation panel. Choose `customer-edit.xml` screen and click *Edit*.

* Go to the *Datasources* tab on the screen designer page and click *New*.

* Select the newly created data source in the list. Its attributes will appear in the right part of the page.

* Specify `collectionDatasource` in the *Type* field.

* In *Id* field enter the data source identifier − `ordersDs`.

* Select `com.sample.sales.entity.Order` entity in the *Entity* list.

* Select `++_local++` view in the *View* list.

* Enter the following query in the *Query* field:
+
[source, jpql]
----
select o from sales$Order o where o.customer.id = :ds$customerDs order by o.date
----
+
The query contains orders selection criterion with `ds$customerDs` parameter. The parameter value named like `++ds${datasource_name}++` will contain id of the entity selected in `++datasource_name++` datasource at the moment, in this case it is the id of the Customer being edited.
+
image::qs_customer_screen_orders_ds.png[align="center"]

* Click *Apply* to save the changes. 

* Next go to the *Layout* tab in the screen designer and find the `Label` component in the components palette. Drag this component to the screen components hierarchy panel and place it between `fieldGroup` and `windowActions`. Go to the *Properties* tab in the properties panel. Enter `msg://orders` in the *value* field. Click the image:localization.png[] button next to the *value* field and define label values in available languages.
+
image::qs_customer_screen_label.png[align="center"]

[TIP]
====
If the application is not intended to be used in multiple languages, the value in the *value* field can be entered straight in the required language.
====

* Drag `Table` from the components palette to components hierarchy panel and place it between `label` and `windowActions`. Select this component in the hierarchy and specify table size in properties on the *Layout* tab: set `100%` in the *width* field and `200px` in the *height* field.
+
Go to the *Properties* tab. Set `ordersTable` value as *id*, choose `orderDs` from the list of available datasources.
+
image::qs_customer_screen_table.png[align="center"]

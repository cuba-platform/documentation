==== Customer Editor With a List of Orders

Do the following to display the list of orders in the `Customer` edit screen:

Go to the *Generic UI* section of CUBA project tree. Open the `customer-edit.xml` screen for editing.

Switch to the *Designer* tab.

In the components palette find *Collection* in the <<gui_data,Data components>> group. Drag this component to the *data* section in screen components hierarchy panel.

Select the `com.company.sales.entity.Order` entity and its `_local` view for the data container. Generate the loader ID using the image:generate_id.png[] button.

Add the WHERE clause to the generated query to select only the orders that have a reference to the edited customer:

[source, plain]
----
select e from sales_Order e where e.customer = :customer
----

Finally, you should see a data container which will load the `Order` instances in customer-edit screen XML descriptor:

[source, xml]
----
include::{sourcesdir}/qs/ordersCt.xml[]
----

Drag `Table` from the components palette to components hierarchy panel and place it between `label` and `editActions`. Select this component in the hierarchy and specify table size in the *Properties* tab: set `300px` in the *width* field and `200px` in the *height* field. Choose `ordersDc` from the list of available data containers. Then generate the table identifier using the image:generate_id.png[] button next to the *id* field: `ordersTable`.


Next, right-click on the table and select *Wrap Into > Group Box* from the context menu. Go to the *Properties* tab on the properties panel of this group box and  enter `Orders` in the *caption* field and set group box width to 320 px.

[TIP]
====
If the application is intended to be used in multiple languages, use the image:localization.png[] button next to the *caption* field to create the new <<messages,message>> `msg://orders` and define label values in required languages.

As a result, the `customer-edit.xml` code on the *Text* tab will look as follows:

[source, xml]
----
include::{sourcesdir}/qs/customer-edit.xml[]
----

Open the `CustomerEdit` screen controller. The image:quick_start/class_button.png[©] and image:quick_start/xml_button.png[<>] buttons on the gutter enable quick switching between the screen descriptor and controller.

First - we need to disable automatic data load for the screen, because we need custom data load process. To disable automatic data load, remove `@LoadDataBeforeShow` annotation from the class.

<<screen_controller_injection,Inject>> the orders loader in the controller class by pressing `Alt+Insert` inside the class definition and selecting `ordersDl` from the list. Or you can just type the following code manually:

[source, java]
----
@Inject
private CollectionLoader<Order> ordersDl;
----

Then, subscribe to the `BeforeLoadDataEvent` to set the `customer` parameter value for the `ordersDl` data loader. To do this, click Alt+Insert znd select *Subscribe to Event > BeforeShowEvent* in the *Generate* menu. And, of course, you can just add the following code manually.

[source, java]
----
include::{sourcesdir}/qs/CustomerEdit.java[]
----

This method will be in charge of loading related `Order` instances.

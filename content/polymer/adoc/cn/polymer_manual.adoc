== Polymer Core

https://www.polymer-project.org[Google Polymer] is a JavaScript library that allows you to create reusable https://www.webcomponents.org[Web Components]. CUBA Polymer UI module is built on it, so it's important to understand basics of this framework.

Google Polymer has an https://www.polymer-project.org/2.0/docs/devguide/feature-overview[official development guide].
However, to facilitate the learning process we created our own quick manual that accents the most important
features of the library and provides a number of examples for better understanding of how various features can be used.

The Polymer library currently has two major versions: 1.0 and 2.0, with very different syntax. All our
examples use Polymer 2.0.

=== Sample XLS Report

In this chapter we will consider the structure of one of reports from the sample *Library* application, which source code is available at https://github.com/cuba-platform/sample-library.

To use reports in your project, activate the *reports* item in the *App components* list on the *Project properties* page
of CUBA Studio.

Open the *Reports* -> *Reports* screen and click on the *Import* button to import the report. Choose Reports.zip in the project root directory. Two reports will appear in the table, one of them will be Books by author. This report displays the list of book publications for selected author; books will be grouped by book name and publisher. The output format is XLS.

Let us consider report bands.

* *header* band - report header. It contains the dataset with the Groovy script which outputs the report <<parameters, external parameters>> values:

[source, groovy]
----
[['authorName' : (params['author'].firstName + ' ' + params['author'].lastName)]]
----

* The *book* band outputs the list of books by running the following SQL query:

[source, sql]
----
select b.name as book_name, b.id as book_id
from library_book b 
    join library_book_author_link ba on ba.book_id = b.id
    join library_author a on a.id = ba.author_id
where a.id = ${author}
----

This query uses the external report parameter - *author*. The parameter has the *Entity* type, however in SQL queries you can compare it directly with entity identifier fields; the conversion will be done automatically.

* The *publisher* band, which is a child band of *book*, outputs the book publishers by running the following SQL query:

[source, sql]
----
select p.name as publisher, bp.year, p.id as publisher_id
from library_book_publication bp
    join library_publisher p on p.id = bp.publisher_id
where bp.book_id = ${book.book_id}
----

This query uses the parent band field `++book_id++` as a parameter. This provides dependency between the parent and child bands.

* The *publication* band, which is a child of the *publisher* band, outputs the book publications by running the following SQL query:

[source, sql]
----
select ld.name as department, count(bi.id) as amount
from library_book_instance bi
    join library_book_publication bp on bp.id = bi.book_publication_id
    join library_library_department ld on ld.id = bi.library_department_id
where bp.publisher_id = ${publisher.publisher_id} and bp.book_id = ${book.book_id}
group by ld.name
----

This query uses both parent bands fields as parameters - `++book_id++` and `++publisher_id++`.
--

. Report <<parameters, parameters>>.
+
The *Parameters and Formats* tab contains one declared report external parameter - *Author*:
+
image::sample1_param.png[align="center"]
+
When running the report, the user will have to enter this parameter. The author selection will be performed via the `library$Author.lookup` screen, available in the application.

. Report <<template, templates>>.
+
The *Templates* tab contains a single defined XLS template, loaded from `BooksByAuthor.xls`
+
image::sample1_template.png[align="center"]

. Report Name <<localization, Localization>>.
+
The *Localization* tab contains the report name for the Russian locale:
+
[source, properties]
----
ru = Книги по автору
----

You can <<running, run>> report from the generic browser in the *Reports* -> *Run Reports* screen.

[[crosstab_xls]]
=== Sample Crosstab Report

To create a crosstab report, select *Crosstab* band orientation on the <<structure,Report structure>> tab of the report editor. This orientation automatically adds three datasets to the band:

. `<band_name>`*_dynamic_header* - the data from this dataset is copied to the right like a vertical band with table columns header.

. `<band_name>`*_master_data* - the data from this dataset is copied downwards like a horizontal band with table rows header.

. `<band_name>` - the dataset named the same as the band it belongs to. It is the main content band that will fulfill the matrix cells.

These datasets can have any of available dataset types: <<structure_sql,SQL>>, <<structure_jpql,JPQL>>, <<structure_groovy,Groovy>>, and so on.

For example, a crosstab report for the `Order` entity of the https://github.com/cuba-platform/sample-sales[Sales] sample application may have the following structure:

image::crosstab_structure.png[align="center"]

* Here, the `orders_dynamic_header` dataset will return the list of months names:
+
[source, groovy]
.orders_dynamic_header dataset
----
include::{sourcesdir}/crosstab_dynamic_header.groovy[]
----

* The `orders_master_data` dataset returns names and identifiers of the customers selected by the user as an <<parameters,external report parameter>>:
+
[source, sql]
.orders_master_data dataset
----
include::{sourcesdir}/crosstab_master_data.sql[]
----

* The `orders` dataset will provide data for the matrix cells, which is the order amounts sum for the particular month and customer. It takes `orders_master_data@customer_id` (the customer id) as the Y-coordinate of the cell, and `orders_dynamic_header@header_id` (the month name) as the X-coordinate, and fills the matrix cell with the `amount` value.
+
In the example below the report has two more external parameters: the `start_date` and the `end_date` that define the range of order dates. It would be a good idea to set up <<report_parameter_validation,cross-parameter validation>> to make sure the range makes sense.
+
[source, sql]
.orders dataset
----
include::{sourcesdir}/crosstab_orders.sql[]
----

Then you can create a report template using Microsoft Office or LibreOffice.

The report template should contain <<template_xls_regions,named regions>> for all three datasets of the crosstab band and, additionally, the named region for the column header: `<band_name>_header`. In our case it is `orders_header`.

Below is an example of a template which outputs the list of `Customers` vertically and `Orders` made by each customer horizontally grouped by the months the orders were placed.

image::crosstab_template_2.png[align="center"]

image::crosstab_names_regions.png[align="center"]

As a result, the report is extended both vertically and horizontally and aggregates the order amounts for each customer and each month:

image::crosstab_result.png[align="center"]

If you want to add totals for the report, you should do it in separate bands with their own datasets.

=== Sample JRXML Report

The example is also based the sample *Library* application, which source code is available on https://github.com/cuba-platform/sample-library[GitHub].

To use reports in your project, activate the *reports* item in the *App components* list on the *Project properties* page
of CUBA Studio.

Open the *Reports* -> *Reports* screen and click on the *Import* button to import the report. Choose Reports.zip in the project root directory. Two reports will appear in the table, one of them will be Book availability in department. This report displays the list of book publications in the selected department; the default output format is XLS. Let's create the new JasperReports template for this report.

. <<structure, Report data structure>>.

Let's consider report bands.

* *Header* band - report header. It contains the dataset with the Groovy script which outputs the report <<parameters, external parameters>> value:
+
[source, groovy]
----
[['library_department_name' : params['library_department'].name]]
----

* *Data* band outputs the list of book instances in the department passed as a parameter by running the following Groovy script:
+
[source, groovy]
----
include::{sourcesdir}/example_jasper.groovy[]
----
+
This query uses the external report parameter - `library_department`. The parameter has the *Entity* type, however you can compare it directly with entity identifier fields; the conversion will be done automatically.
--

. Report <<parameters, parameters>>.
+
The *Parameters and Formats* tab contains one declared report external parameter - *Department*:
+
image::sample_jasper_2.png[align="center"]
+
When running the report, the user will have to enter this parameter. The department selection will be performed via the `library$LibraryDepartment.lookup` screen, available in the application.

. Report <<template_jasper, template>>.
+
--
The *Templates* tab contains a single defined XLS template, loaded from `BookAvailability.xls`.

Create the new JRXML file with the following content:

[source, xml]
.BookAvailability.jrxml
----
include::{sourcesdir}/jasper.jrxml[]
----

The table in this template is bound to a subDataset. The `title` element uses the *Header* band data directly. You can open the template file in JasperReports visual designer to see the report layout.

Upload the new template to the application, selecting any output type, and make it default:

[[example_html]]
=== Sample HTML/PDF Report with Paging, Headers and Footers

Let's imagine that we now want to create a report with landscape orientation, page numbers, fixed header and footer on each page, configured using special CSS rules and properties. The output format is HTML exported to PDF.

This sample report with its demo project are also available on https://github.com/cuba-labs/reports-pdf-page-settings[CUBA GitHub].

. Data model

+
--
Our report will display information on the `Client` entity. It contains two String attributes: `title` and `summary`, we will use them in our report structure.

[source, java]
----
include::{sourcesdir}/examples_html.java[]
----
--

. <<structure,Creating report>>
+
--
Let's create a simple report without parameters. The JPQL query will select all clients with their local attributes: `title` and `summary`.

image::example_html_1.png[align="center"]
--

. <<template_html, Report template>>.

+
--
Now let's create the report template file. Here we define header and footer blocks that will be printed on each PDF page. Also we use special `page-break-before`: `always` CSS property. It will generate page break before each client info block.

As you can see, we use *FreeMarker* statements to insert data to our template. See complete FreeMarker reference here: https://freemarker.apache.org/docs/.

[source, html]
----
include::{sourcesdir}/examples_html.html[]
----
--

. CSS rules
+
--
We will use the following CSS code to tune our PDF page representation:

[source, css]
----
include::{sourcesdir}/examples_html_1.css[]
----

This CSS code will set header/footer positions:

[source, css]
----
include::{sourcesdir}/examples_html_2.css[]
----

After that we need to fix paddings of the main content to prevent content and header/footer overlapping:

[source, css]
----
include::{sourcesdir}/examples_html_3.css[]
----

So, the complete `paging-template.html` file will look as below:

[source, html]
----
include::{sourcesdir}/examples_html_5.html[]
----
--

. Upload the template file and run the report.
+
--

image::example_html_3.png[align="center"]

As you can see, the report contains the title page and page breaks before each client's page. There are headers and footers on each page as well.

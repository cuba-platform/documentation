[[wizard]]
== Quick Start

This chapter provides the hands-on examples of using the Report generator. All the examples are based on the sample https://github.com/cuba-platform/sample-library[Library] application which is available in CUBA Studio samples.

For an easy start, the report generator comes with the Reports wizard - a visual tool for quick report creation, including both data structure and template design. Having created a report with the wizard, you can then decompose it and learn how the <<structure,datasets>> are created, explore the report <<parameters,parameters>>, modify the <<template,template>> or the <<template_to_output,output type>>, following the further sections of this manual.

To run the wizard, click *Create* -> *Using wizard* in the *Reports* screen.

.Reports Wizard
image::reports_wizard_main.png[align="center"]

Three types of reports can be created using the wizard:

. Report for a single entity.
. Report for a list of given entities.
. Report for a list of entities filtered by query.

Report design is a three steps process:

. Creating a data structure of a report.
. Editing of report regions.
. Saving the report.

The created report can be modified in the usual manner using the report editor and run through <<run_common, the generic report browser>>, or using `TablePrintFormAction` and `EditorPrintFormAction` <<run_actions, actions>>.

[[single_entity_report]]
=== Report for a Single Entity

Let us assume that we want to get an information about the particular publication of a book, i.e. an instance of `library$BookPublication` entity.

First, run the reports wizard and specify the report details:

* *Entity* - entity to be shown in the report - `library$BookPublication`.
* *Template type* - report template format that defines the format of the output - DOCX. Note that XSLX and PDF formats are also available.
* *Report name* - `++'Publication details'++`.

Next, specify the report type: *Report for single entity*.

.Report for a Single Entity

Then click *Next* button; the *Select attributes for the simple report region* window appears. Specify the attributes of the `BookPublication` entity and linked entities that should be reflected in the report (`Publication.Book.Name`, `Publication.Publisher.Name`, `Publication.Year` and `Publication.City.Name`). In order to do this, select them in the left column and move them to the right clicking image:attributes_selection_arrow.png[] or by double-click.

The order of the attributes in the report will correspond to the order specified in the right-hand side list. To change the display order, move the attributes up and down by clicking image:attributes_selection_up.png[]/image:attributes_selection_down.png[].

.Select Entity Attributes
image::single_entity_attributes.png[align="center"]

Click *ОК* to move to the second stage - report regions editing.

The appeared screen contains a list of named regions - bands that display related data. The wizard enables adding several plain-text regions to the template in order to display different data sets.

A set of entity attributes loaded to a particular region can be modified by clicking the link represented as the list of the selected attributes. You can also add a new region by clicking *Add simple region*.

If the entity contains collection attributes, *Add tabulated region*, the button will appear. It enables adding a region for tabular data display.

In both cases, the selection dialog will appear with a list of attributes of the `library$BookPublication` entity, allowing you to add or remove attributes from the set.

.Report creation
image::single_entity_step_2.png[align="center"]

At this stage, we already can run the report and see how the report looks. Click *Run* button, pick the instance of `library$BookPublication` and see the result.

.Test Run
image::single_entity_test_running.png[align="center"]

When all report regions are configured you can move on to the third stage: saving the report. At this point, you can view the complete report template, or change the name and format of the output file to one of the available types.

.Report output type
image::single_entity_step_3.png[align="center"]

After clicking the *Save* button, the standard report editor comes up. Now you can fine-tune the report in the usual manner. Once editing is complete, click *Save and close* in the report editor.

The report is now added to the *General* reports group in the reports browser, where you can run it from by clicking the *Run* buttons.

.Reports browser
image::single_entity_reports_list.png[align="center"]

Additionally, we can enable the report run on the publications browser. In order to do this, we will add the *Print details* button to the `bookpublication-browse.xml` screen descriptor:

[source, xml]
----
<groupTable id="bookPublicationTable"
    ...
    <buttonsPanel>
        ...
        <button id="printDetails"
        caption="msg://printDetails"/>
----

Then we need to implement `TablePrintFormAction` in the controller:

[source, java]
----
@Inject
private Button printDetails;

@Override
public void init(Map<String, Object> params) {
    TablePrintFormAction action = new TablePrintFormAction("report", bookPublicationTable);
          bookPublicationTable.addAction(action);
          printDetails.setAction(action);
    }
----

Finally, we should link our report with the `BookPublication` browser. Open the report editor, switch to the *Roles and Screens* tab and add the `library$BookPublication.lookup` screen from the dropdown list to the table below:

.Add screen
image::single_entity_screens.png[align="center"]

Now you can run the report for any publication by selecting it in the table and simply clicking the *Print details* button.

.Print details
image::single_entity_running.png[align="center"]

The output is as follows:

.Report result
image::single_entity_result.png[align="center"]

[[list_of_entities_report]]
=== Report for a List of Entities

Reports wizard allows you to create two types of reports for a list of entity instances:

. Report for manually selected instances of a particular entity
. Report for entity instances filtered by a certain request.

Let us have a look at the first report type. Let us assume we want to obtain a list of all book instances in the library (`library$BookInstance` entity) with titles and library departments they belong to.

At the first stage, we specify the report details:

* *Entity* - report entity - `library$BookInstance`.
* *Template type* - output format - XSLX.
* *Report name* - report name - `++'Book items location'++`.

After that, select the type of the report (*Report for list of entities*) and click *Next*.

.Report for a List of Entities
image::list_of_entities_step_1.png[align="center"]

As per the task, we select `BookItem.Publication.Book.Name` and `BookItem.LibraryDepartment.Name` in the attributes selection window.

.Select Entity Attributes
image::list_of_entities_attributes.png[align="center"]

Click *ОК* and move to the second stage of report regions editing.

The report template for a list of entities restricted to have only one region that displays data in tabular form. Adding new regions is not allowed, but you can edit an existing set of data by clicking on the link with the list of attributes, or remove an existing region and recreate it.

In this case, we do not need to make any changes. Click *Next* -> *Save* to save the report. The report looks as follows in the report editor:

.Report data structure
image::list_of_entities_editor.png[align="center"]

Once the report is saved, you can run it from the reports browser.

In addition, we can add a button to run the report from the book items browser, which can be opened by clicking the *Show items* button in the publications browser. In order to do this, we will set the `multiselect` attribute for the book instances table to `true` to be able to specify a set of records for the report and then add the source code of the button:

[source, xml]
----
      <table id="bookInstanceTable"
             multiselect="true">
             ...
                  <buttonsPanel>
                  ...
                      <button id="printList"
                      caption="msg://printList"/>
----

After that, inject the `Button` component in the screen controller:

[source, java]
----
@Inject
private Button printList;
----

Next, add the following implementation within the overridden `init()` method:

[source, java]
----
TablePrintFormAction action = new TablePrintFormAction("report", bookInstanceTable);
    bookInstanceTable.addAction(action);
    printList.setAction(action);
----

Finally, we should link the *Book items location* report with the book items browser. Open the report editor, switch to the *Roles and Screens* tab and add the `library$BookInstance.lookup` screen from the screens dropdown to the table below:

.Add screen
image::list_of_entities_screens.png[align="center"]

Now the report can be run from the book items browser by selecting items for the report in the table and pressing the *Print list* button. *Print selected* option exports the selected items, *Print all* option prints all instances selected by the current filter.

.Print selected
image::list_of_entities_running.png[align="center"]

The output is as follows:

.Report result
image::list_of_entities_result.png[align="center"]

[[query_report]]
=== Report for a List of Entities Filtered by Query

Now let's have a look at the last report type suggested by the wizard: the report for a list of entities filtered by a query. To demonstrate this use case, we will complicate the previous example. As before, the report will contain a list of books (with their titles and department names), but only added after a certain date.

Let us set the details of the report like in the previous case:

* *Entity* - report entity - `library$BookInstance`.
* *Template type* - output file format - XSLX.
* *Report name* - `++'Recently added book items'++`.

Then select the *Report for list of entities, selected by query* report type.

.Report for a List of Entities Filtered by Query
image::query_step_1.png[align="center"]

The selected report type allows us to select the list of entities that match the specified conditions. In order to set the query, click *Set query* link below.

The *Define query* window appears. As you can see, the window is similar to the generic filter window. Here you specify conditions, combine them into AND/OR groups and configure their settings.

In order to add a new query condition, click *Add*. Select `Created at` attribute in the appeared window. Now the attribute is added to the query conditions tree and the right-hand side panel displays its properties.

In the properties panel, you can set the default parameter value. If the report logic is not supposed to be changed, you can make this attribute hidden by checking the *Hidden* checkbox. In this case, the user will not be requested to input this parameter when running the report.

Select an operator (>=).

.Query Parameter
image::query_parameter.png[align="center"]

After saving the query, click *Next* and move to `library$BookInstance` attributes selection. We move `BookItem.Publication.Book.Name` and `BookItem.LibraryDepartment.Name` attributes to the right. Click *OK* to move on to accomplish the first stage.

.Select Entity Attributes
image::list_of_entities_attributes.png[align="center"]

Press *Next* -> *Save* to save the report.

.Entity attributes
image::query_step_2.png[align="center"]

The report will look as follows:

.Report data structure
image::query_editor.png[align="center"]

The editor enables making the report structure more sophisticated by adding new bands and data sets, as well as configuring the report template design, localization, access rights.

For instance, we can switch to *Parameters and Formats* tab and modify the query parameter in the *Parameters* list: `Date` instead of the standard `CreateTs1`. Save the changes and close the report editor.

.Parameters and Formats tab
image::query_parameter_rename.png[align="center"]

After all, let us add the *Report* button that runs the report right from the library departments browser.

In order to do this, we need to define a button in the `librarydepartment-browse.xml` screen descriptor:

[source, xml]
----
<table id="libraryDepartmentTable"
    ...
    <buttonsPanel id="buttonsPanel">
        ...
        <button id="reportBtn"
         caption="msg://reportBtn"/>
     </buttonsPanel>
</table>
----

After that, inject the button in the screen controller:

[source, java]
----
@Inject
private Button reportBtn;
----

and assign `RunReportAction` to the button in the overridden `init()` method:

[source, java]
----
reportBtn.setAction(new RunReportAction("report"));
----

For each report, add `library$LibraryDepartment.lookup` to the screens list on the *Roles and Screens* tab of the report editor, as we did in the previous examples.

The *Report* button will appear in the library departments browser, displaying the list of all reports available in the system in one click. In order to run the report, select *Recently added book items* in the list, specify the date and click *Run report*.

.Run report

The output is as follows:

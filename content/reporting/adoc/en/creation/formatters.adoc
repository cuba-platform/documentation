=== Field Value Formats

You can specify the formatting for any field output by the report in the *Parameters and Formats* tab of the report editor. Below is the form to add a format:

.Field Value Formats

* *Value name* – report field name with the band prefix, for example, `Book.name`.
* *Format string* – field format. For number values specify the format according to the `java.text.DecimalFormat` rules, for dates – `java.text.SimpleDateFormat`.

With the help of formats, it is possible to insert images and HTML blocks into the document.

* In order to insert an image, specify the image URL as the field value, and the format string must be as follows: `${image:<Width>x<Height>}`, for example, `${image:200x300}`.

To work with the `FileDescriptor`, use the `${imageFileId:WxH}` value formatter that accepts both the `FileDescriptor` `id` and the link to the `FileDecriptor` instance itself.

* In order to insert an HTML block, you should return an HTML markup in the field, and select `${html}` as the format string. In the output value, you may omit top-level tags up to `<body>` inclusive. If necessary, all missing top-level tags will be added automatically. All blocks should be encoded with `UTF-8`. CSS and the `style` attribute are not supported.

You can specify your own custom formats as well. To do this, type the new value in the field without opening the dropdown and press *Enter*. You can also choose any format from the dropdown, edit its name in the field and press *Enter*. Custom format will be saved in both cases.

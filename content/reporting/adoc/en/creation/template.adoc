=== Report Template

You can create several templates for a single report in the *Templates* tab of the report editor. One of them must be selected as the default template in the *Report structure* tab.

Below is the form to add a template:

* *Template code* - template code for its identification.

* *Template file* - template file, which is loaded from the file system and saved to the database along with the report structure description.

* *Output type* - report output type. It should be consistent with the template file type according to the rules described in <<template_to_output>>.

* *Output name pattern* - optional file name pattern, which will be used for the produced report download.
It can either be a constant string or contain report parameter as a variable, e.g. `${header.authorName}.xlsx`. More sophisticated patterns with several parameters and string concatenation can also be created as a script in any band of report structure, e.g. `${Root.title}.xlsx`, where `title` is a result of the script:
+
[source, groovy]
----
[['title' : ('Report for '+params['author'].firstName+' '+params['author'].lastName)]]
----

* *Is custom* - flag to use custom formatting logic not covered by any provided formatter.

* *Defined by* - the way the custom template is defined: by a <<template_custom,class>>, script or URL.

* *Custom definition* - the fully qualified name of the Java class, the path to the Groovy script in the *core* module, or the URL used to create the template.

* *Is alterable output* - flag to let the user choose the output type of a report at runtime in a dialog window.

If the flag is on, a dialog with output type selection will be shown when running a report. If the report has more than one template, the template selection dropdown will be shown as well.

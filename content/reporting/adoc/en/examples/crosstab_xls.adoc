=== Sample Crosstab Report

To create a crosstab report, select *Crosstab* band orientation on the <<structure,Report structure>> tab of the report editor. This orientation automatically adds three datasets to the band:

. `<band_name>`*_dynamic_header* – the data from this dataset is copied to the right like a vertical band with table columns header.

. `<band_name>`*_master_data* – the data from this dataset is copied downwards like a horizontal band with table rows header.

. `<band_name>` – the dataset named the same as the band, it belongs to. It is the main content band that will fulfill the matrix cells.

These datasets can have any of available dataset types: <<structure_sql,SQL>>, <<structure_jpql,JPQL>>, <<structure_groovy,Groovy>>, and so on.

For example, a crosstab report for the `Order` entity of the https://github.com/cuba-platform/sample-sales-cuba7[Sales] sample application has the following structure:

.Crosstab Report

* Here, the `orders_dynamic_header` dataset will return the list of months names:
+
[source, groovy]
.orders_dynamic_header dataset
----
include::{sourcesdir}/crosstab_dynamic_header.groovy[]
----

* The `orders_master_data` dataset returns names and identifiers of the customers selected by the user as an <<parameters,external report parameter>>:
+
[source, sql]
.orders_master_data dataset
----
include::{sourcesdir}/crosstab_master_data.sql[]
----

* The `orders` dataset will provide data for the matrix cells, which is the order amounts sum for the particular month and customer. It takes `orders_master_data@customer_id` (the customer id) as the Y-coordinate of the cell, and `orders_dynamic_header@header_id` (the month name) as the X-coordinate, and fills the matrix cell with the `amount` value.
+
In the example below the report has two more external parameters: the `start_date` and the `end_date` that define the range of order dates. It would be a good idea to set up <<report_parameter_validation,cross-parameter validation>> to make sure the range makes sense.
+
[source, sql]
.orders dataset
----
include::{sourcesdir}/crosstab_orders.sql[]
----

Then you can create a report template using Microsoft Office or LibreOffice.

The report template should contain <<template_xls_regions,named regions>> for all three datasets of the crosstab band and, additionally, the named region for the column header: `<band_name>_header`. In our case it is `orders_header`.

Below is an example of a template which outputs the list of `Customers` vertically and `Orders` made by each customer horizontally grouped by the months the orders were placed.

.Crosstab template

.Named regions
image::crosstab_names_regions.png[align="center"]

As a result, the report is extended both vertically and horizontally and aggregates the order amounts for each customer and each month:

.Crosstab result

If you want to add totals for the report, you should do it in separate bands with their own datasets.

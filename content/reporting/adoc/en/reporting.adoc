== Preface

This document provides guidance for creating reports in applications built on CUBA platform.

[[audience]]
=== Intended Audience

This manual is intended for developers and administrators of CUBA applications. In order to work successfully with the report generator, you should understand relational database principles and be able to write SQL queries. Familiarizing yourself with JPQL and Groovy is also useful, because in some cases it is easier to extract report data using these languages.

== Overview

The Reporting add-on is designed to simplify the report generation in CUBA applications. It enables creating report <<template,templates>> in most popular editors like Microsoft Office and Libre/Open Office and defining <<structure,data sources>> at runtime, using CUBA data model, SQL, JPQL or scripts.

The add-on supports:

* Building report templates visually at runtime with a step-by-step <<wizard,wizard>>;
* Generating reports in DOC, DOCX, ODT, XLS, XLSX, HTML or in arbitrary text formats;
* Creating complex XLS(X) reports: multi-tiered reports, reports with data aggregation, <<crosstab_xls,crosstab>> reports;
* Using diagrams and formulas in XLS(X) reports;
* Converting reports in office formats or HTML to PDF.

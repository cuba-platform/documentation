== Running Reports

This section describes how to run created reports.

[[run_common]]
=== Running from the Generic Reports Browser

The easiest way to run reports is from the generic browser, which is available in the *Reports* -> *Run Reports* screen. The user must have the right to access this screen. The list will contain all reports that are <<permissions, available to the user>> in accordance with his role. If the report has external parameters, they will be requested in a special form when running the report.

[[run_actions]]
=== Running Reports from Screens

You can run reports from arbitrary screens using special actions and associated buttons or component context menu items. In such case report <<permissions, availability>> in this screen will also be checked in addition to user role.

Action types and examples of their use are provided below.

* `com.haulmont.reports.gui.actions.RunReportAction` - action showing the list of all available reports. When a user selects a report from the list, the parameters input form is displayed (if any were defined) and the report is run.
+
Below is an example of using the action together with a button declared in the screen XML descriptor:

** XML-descriptor
+
[source, xml]
----
<layout>
    <table id="bookTable">
        ...
        <buttonsPanel id="buttonsPanel">
            ...          
            <button id="reportButton"
                    icon="icons/reports-print.png"/>
        </buttonsPanel>
    </table>
----

** Controller
+
[source, java]
----
@Inject
private Button reportButton;

@Override
public void init(Map<String, Object> params) {
    reportButton.setAction(new RunReportAction("report"));
}
----

** messages.properties
+
[source]
----
report = Report
----

* `com.haulmont.reports.gui.actions.TablePrintFormAction` - an action associated with a table displaying a list of entity instances. The action only selects reports having an external parameter of the *Entity* or the *List of entities* type and where the parameter entity type matches the entity type displayed by the table. If only one report is available as a result of selection, it is invoked immediately. If several reports are available, their list is offered to the user for selection.
+
The external parameter value is passed to the report using the following rules:

** If the parameter has the *List of entities* type, the list of instances currently selected in the table is passed into it.

** If the parameter has the *Entity* type, and the table has a single instance selected (one row is highlighted), then this instance is passed into the report.

** If the parameter is of the *Entity* type, and the table has several rows selected, then the report runs several times according to the number of selected instances. After execution, the user gets a single ZIP archive containing all generated reports.
+
Below is an example of using the action in a button and the table context menu:

** XML descriptor
+
[source, xml]
----
<layout>
    <table id="bookTable">
        ...
        <buttonsPanel id="buttonsPanel">
            ...          
            <button id="reportButton"
                    icon="icons/reports-print.png"/>
        </buttonsPanel>
    </table>
----

** Controller
+
[source, java]
----
@Inject
private Button reportButton;

@Inject
private Table bookTable;

@Override
public void init(Map<String, Object> params) {
    TablePrintFormAction action = new TablePrintFormAction("report", bookTable);
    bookTable.addAction(action);
    reportButton.setAction(action);
}
----

** messages.properties
+
[source, groovy]
----
report = Report
----

* `com.haulmont.reports.gui.actions.EditorPrintFormAction` an action associated with an entity editor screen. The action only selects reports having an external parameter of the *Entity* or the *List of entities* type and where the parameter entity type matches the edited entity type. If only one report is available as a result of selection, it is invoked immediately. If several reports are available, their list is offered to user for selection.
+
The external parameter value - edited entity instance - is passed into the report. If the parameter has the *List of entities* type, then a list containing a single item is passed.
+
Below is an example of using the action in a button located near the standard *OK* and *Cancel* buttons:

** XML descriptor
+
[source, xml]
----
<layout expand="windowActionsBox">
    ...
    <hbox id="windowActionsBox"
          spacing="true">
        <iframe id="windowActions"
                screen="editWindowActions"/>
        <button id="reportButton"/>
    </hbox>
</layout>
----

** Controller
+
[source, java]
----
@Inject
private Button reportButton;

@Override
public void init(Map<String, Object> params) {
    reportButton.setAction(new EditorPrintFormAction("report", this, null));
}
----

** messages.properties
+
[source, groovy]
----
report = Report

[[run_cancel]]
=== Cancelling Reports

If the report execution is running as a background task, it can be interrupted by the user.

To add the cancel option, set the `reporting.useBackgroundReportProcessing` property in the *Administration > Application Properties* screen.

[source, groovy]
----
reporting.useBackgroundReportProcessing = true
----

Thus, the window with progress bar and a *Cancel* button will be displayed:

image::run_cancel.png[align="center"]

You can also set the processing timeout using the `reporting.backgroundReportProcessingTimeoutMs` property:

[source, groovy]
----
reporting.backgroundReportProcessingTimeoutMs = 30000
----

When the time is up, the task will be canceled regardless the result, and the user will receive an error message:

image::run_cancel_2.png[align="center"]

To cancel the report execution programmatically, you can use the `cancelReportExecution()` method of the `ReportService` interface that takes the identifiers of the user session and the report:

[source, java]
----
reportService.cancelReportExecution(userSessionId, report.getId());
----

=== Cancelling Reports

If the report execution is running as a background task, it can be interrupted by the user.

To add the cancel option, set the <<reporting.useBackgroundReportProcessing,reporting.useBackgroundReportProcessing>> property in the *Administration > Application Properties* screen.

[source, groovy]
----
reporting.useBackgroundReportProcessing = true
----

Thus, the window with the progress bar and the *Cancel* button will be displayed:

.Cancel report

You can also set the processing timeout using the <<reporting.backgroundReportProcessingTimeoutMs,reporting.backgroundReportProcessingTimeoutMs>> property:

[source, groovy]
----
reporting.backgroundReportProcessingTimeoutMs = 30000
----

When the time is up, the task will be canceled regardless the result, and the user will receive an error message:

.Report error

To cancel the report execution programmatically, use the `cancelReportExecution()` method of the `ReportService` interface that takes the identifiers of the user session and the report:

[source, java]
----
reportService.cancelReportExecution(userSessionId, report.getId());
----

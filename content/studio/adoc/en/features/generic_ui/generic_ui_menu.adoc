==== Working with Application Menu

The menu designer allows you to define the application main menu and store it in the `web-menu.xml` configuration file. The *Structure* tab displays the graphical designer, the XML code of the menu can be edited on the *Text* tab.

The menu can be created in two modes:

 * In the *Single mode* the menu contains items from the project's `web-menu.xml` file only. In this case you need to create all items, including those existing in the app components if necessary, but you have full control over the menu structure.

* In the *Composite mode* the menu contains items from the project's `menu.xml` plus from the menu configuration files of all application components. This mode helps to easily include all inherited items and insert the project's specific items at any place of the menu structure. The inherited menu items can not be edited.
+
Additionally, on the *Text* tab, you can define for the menu items the `ìnsertBefore` or `insertAfter` attribute. These attributes define where to insert the current item. These attributes help to combine the project menu items with the items inherited from the application components in the *Composite* mode.
+
For example, if you want to place your menu structure to the left of the _Administration_ item, set `insertBefore="administration"` for the root item of your hierarchy.

The list of menu configuration files is defined by the {main_man_url}/app_properties_reference.html#cuba.menuConfig[cuba.menuConfig] application property, which is updated when you select the mode.

In order to add a menu item, select an existing item (or the configuration file to create a top-level item) and click image:plus_button.png[+]. The Menu item editor window will be opened in a modal window.

You can create the following types of menu items:

Screen::

image::features/generic_ui/web_menu_create.png[float="right"]

A menu item which opens an application screen.

You should specify the following properties for a *Screen* item:

* *Screen* - non-unique ID of screen that is opened by this menu item.
* *Id* - an arbitrary unique ID of the item.
* *Open type* - defines whether the screen should be opened in a new tab or in a modal window (`NEW_TAB` or `DIALOG`). `NEW_TAB` is used by default.
* *Shortcut* - a keyboard shortcut which opens the screen. Possible modifiers (ALT, CTRL, SHIFT) are separated by a "-", for example ALT-C.
* *Style name* - defines a style name for the menu item. See {main_man_url}/gui_themes.html[Themes] for details.
////
* *Caption* - a menu item caption. The *Edit* button opens the localization window where you should enter captions in languages available for the project. Menu captions are placed in the corresponding main message pack with keys in `menu-config.{item_id}` format, where `{item_id}` is the item identifier, which in this case equals to the ID of the screen being opened.
* *Insert before / Insert after* - a menu item, before/after which you want to insert the current item. This property helps to combine the project menu items with the items inherited from the app components in the *Composite* mode. For example, if you want to place your menu structure to the left of the _Administration_ item, set administration in the *Insert before* field of the root item of your hierarchy.
* *Params* - screen parameters passed to the `init()` method of the opening screen's controller. See {main_man_url}/menu.xml.html[menu.xml] for detailed explanation.
* *Permissions* - allows to restrict access to a menu item. If a user does not have permissions to access the item, it is not displayed. For detailed explanation see {main_man_url}/menu.xml.html[menu.xml], however there is a simpler way to manage access - through the *Screens* tab of the security role editor.

In order to create a managed bean, create a Java class by selecting a package in the project tree and clicking *New > Java Class* in the context menu. Then add the `@Component` annotation to the class as in the example above. To minimize the risk of name conflicts, especially if you are developing an application component, provide a name to the bean explicitly by specifying it in the annotation.

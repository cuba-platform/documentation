[[middleware_services]]
==== Working with Services

{main_man_url}/services.html[Services] are container-managed components that form the application boundary and provide the interface to the client tier. Services may contain the business logic themselves or delegate the execution to <<middleware_beans,managed beans>>.

New service can be created from the *Middleware* context menu:

When you enter the name of the service interface, the corresponding bean name and the service name constant are generated automatically:

After that, the service interface will be created in the *global* module, and its implementation - in the *core* module. Also, the new service will be automatically registered in `web-spring.xml` configuration file.

You can easily switch from the interface to service bean and back using the marker on the left-hand gutter:

As soon as you create a method in the service interface, Studio inspection will suggest you implementing it in the bean class:

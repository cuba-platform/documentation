=== Starting the Application

When Studio imports a CUBA project, it creates a Run/Debug Configuration specifically tailored to run local Tomcat server with the deployed application. So in order to run the application and connect to it with the debugger, just click the debug button next to the selected `CUBA Application` configuration in the main toolbar:

See the status in the *Console* tab of the *Debug* tool window. You can click to the link printed after the `Server started at` message to open the application UI in the default web browser.

You can also open the running application in the web browser using the *Runs At...* CUBA tree section:

In order to view the application server output, switch to the *catalina.out* tab:

You can stop the application server by selecting *Run > Stop 'CUBA Application'* in the main menu or by clicking the button in the *Debug* tool window:

Use of Run/Debug Configuration is the preferred way to start the application in development, but Studio also allows you to control the local Tomcat application server through the CUBA main menu items:

When starting the server by the *Start Application Server* main menu command, on Windows you will see a console window with the server output. On Linux and macOS, the console is not shown, but you can see the server log by executing `tail -f deploy/tomcat/logs/app.log` in the *Terminal* tool window. The *Stop Application Server* command stops Tomcat by sending the SHUTDOWN signal to the shutdown port specified in the project properties (8005 by default).

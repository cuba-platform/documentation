== Installation

Before installing CUBA Studio, make sure your system meets the requirements explained in the {main_man_url}/setup.html[Setup] section of the CUBA Developer's Manual.

You can install CUBA Studio in two different forms: as a standalone IDE for your operating system or as a plugin for existing IntelliJ IDEA. The Studio standalone IDE is a special build of IntelliJ IDEA Community Edition which includes the CUBA plugin. If you haven't used IntelliJ IDEA before, we recommend using the standalone IDE.

The IDE has a version corresponding to the IntelliJ IDEA in use, for example, {idea-version}. The CUBA plugin has its own version starting from {plugin-version}.

Installers of the standalone IDE for Windows, macOS and Linux can be downloaded from https://www.cuba-platform.com/download. The plugin is available in the IntelliJ plugins repository (see <<install_plugin,below>>).
